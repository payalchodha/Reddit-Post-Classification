On one hand I feel like I've been given a rare opportunity that I need to take advantage of, but on the other hand I just don't want to. It'll make me burn up vacation time (which I'd rather hold onto for emergencies) and money which I already blew a ton of to pay for my way to my sister's wedding next week (she chose to have a resort wedding in Mexico). I could give the tickets to her and her fiance or to my brother and his girlfriend, but like I said I'd still feel like I'm letting go of a rare opportunity. I dunno,I couldn't find anybody who'd experienced anything similar so I just came to vent. I feel like I'm ungrateful, but I just don't enjoy spending a bunch of money to go somewhere...Thoughts?",1

During this time, we will take a few days to travel and explore independently as well, and we're struggling to think of where/what to visit. We're probably going to spend a day or two in Manhattan, and we're planning to go for a couple of days to the Niagra Falls, and possibly to Washington (although I can't think of anything particularly interesting there except for the whitehouse, which is still not that impressive). However, we're more of the adventurous/nature/culture type than city sighters or history seekers (at least in this case) and would be interested in finding such ideas in the general area, while willing to travel up to ~6 hours away by public transport. One idea was going to the Grand Canyon, until I discovered that it's on the other side of the country. Would anyone have any recommendations for us? Bare in mind we won't be renting a car, but are willing to travel by coach or train. My relatives will be driving us from New Jersey to Boston and back. in advance",1

227,"Snowy Mountains (North America) Travel Advice!Good evening! My boyfriend and I are trying to figure out where wed like to go from the end of December until early January. Were looking for:  snow (most important)
- mountains
- hiking 
- cabin-in-the-woods feel 
- ideally also close to some civilization so we could have a nice dinner once or twice  live in eastern Virginia, right on the coast. Wed like to drive so we could have our car and not go through the added trouble and cost of a rental, but we have limited vacation time, so ideally the drive would only be a day or two worth of driving (no problem with spending the night somewhere on the way). We really wanted to go to Banff National Park, but thatd be like a 3.5 day drive and would eat up lots of time. Before we bite the bullet and look at flying, anyone have any suggestions? Been anywhere on the east coast of North America they loved that fits the description above? We have passports so Canada is an option. ",1

I know that's one of the busiest times of the year but it's the only time we have available.  tentative itinerary is: 8/25-8/28: **Paris** (Versailles, Louvre, etc.) - Any suggestions that are off the beaten path?
* 8/28-8/30: **Lyon** via train (food is all I really know about the town so any other suggestions as well)
* 8/30-9/2: **Chamonix** via train (hiking, Aiguille du Midi cable car)
* 9/2-9/6: **Provence** via train - most likely **Aix-en-Provence** (Verdon Gorge, wineries, exploring)
* 9/6-9/9: **Nice** via train (beaches)
* 9/9: fly out of **Nice** questions:  does this itinerary sound? Should we leave out Lyon for more time in Chamonix/Provence region?  Aix-ev-Provence the best city to stay in the region? We're gonna rent a car to head to Verdon gorge but aside from that we'd like to spend a day or two around the wineries. I've seen tours online for that sort of thing but is there another time we can split the time between where we could rent bikes or something and explore the countryside and the wineries? there somewhere else you would suggest aside from Nice or is that our best option? Our plan currently is to fly out of Nice - but we could change it to just a RT out of Paris and get a train back to Paris at the end from wherever we are. for all the help!",1

 know there are a lot but I'm one of those who don't relax on their vacation but after their return. I'm more like a morning guy and I'm not planning to go out at night much. to be honest  I'm not a huge fan of history, so I'm thinking maybe I have to drop one or two ruins so as to make the itinerary more doable. I should skip Calakmul which is kinda out of the way? few more questions: Should I book accommodation and buses in advance? Since it will be high season (Christmas and New Year's Eve). So far, I have only booked the first two nights in Isla Mujeres.
* The only way to go from Merida to Xpujil is to get the bus from Merida to Campeche and from there to Xpujil?
* I know it is impossible to do all those things that I have copied down in Palenque but which of them are the ones that I cannot miss?
* I've heard there is a tour starting in Palenque and finishing in San Cristobal de las Casas while visiting some waterfalls on the way (Aqua Azul, Misol-Ha). Do they have their own vans or they leave you at the Bus station to get the ADO? Do you have to suggest any tour operator?

What measurements I should do to make sure I will get all proper compensations for it?First, the flight was delayed by two hours, them it was cancelled, so everyone had to pick up their luggage back and go home. It was a Canada to EU trip. I took a taxi back and went home. They told me that the airline will pay for all the taxi bills.  said that the next flight will only be after 48 hours from the original. It is a small company, so they only have one flight each two days. Since I have a home and wont be demanding them to pay hotel, I'm afraid that I'm the last one in line to be seated in another company flight.  know that the law varies and it is not really clear, but I wonder what measurements I should make in order that I won't lose any compensations. It is a huge mess for me, I already lost a booking and a train ride I was planning to do there. after a lot of research, it is NEVER clear what are my rights.

Sometimes there are limited character spaces, especially when you book through meta searchers and OTAs, so how should I write my Name?  
I booked a flight with Eurowings last week from Germany to Austria under the names A and E only - would this be an issue since Germans are not used to multiple names? If I were flying from Portugal or Spain, I know this would not be a problem (although in Spain name B is more important than in Portugal, where name E is more important). Portuguese and Spanish People can kindly share their experiences.  
Please note that this is outside of the U.S., where I already know from experience that the answer there is that you have to put all names at all times.",1

375,"Using Travel Agent for Accessible Travel to Ireland For Travel With Fragile ParentI'm in the very early stages of planning a family trip to Ireland from the United States. The trip would include my mom who is a double-amputee and doesn't have great use of her hands because of arthritis/scleroderma. She is also incredibly fragile and her health can be unpredictable at times. She has always wanted to go to Ireland and we want to try to get her there before it's too late. found [this thread]( which makes me believe that traveling to Ireland is pretty accessible already, which is great to hear. My question is, does it make sense to use a travel agent to help plan an itinerary and do research on places we can visit to make sure they can accommodate a wheelchair as well as help us plan to make sure we are aware of healthcare facilities we can take her to in the event of an emergency? a side-question: Has anyone planned a trip like this with a fragile parent/grandparent/partner that has advice on things to be aware of? Here's a non-comprehensive list of things we're thinking about: Putting together a summary of all major health events
* Renting a vehicle to accommodate the wheelchair
* Accessible accommodations for hotel/wherever we intend to sleep
* Traveling with 2 family members who are healthcare professionals (doctor and nurse practitioner)
* Making sure we have medications covered for the time we'll be in the country
* Research hospitals/emergency care facilities in the event something were to happen",1

I am currently planning a trip to some European countries next year. I am a 26 years old man. I am from Brazil and I live in the Amazon. I am outgoing, interested in sports and outdoor activities. I really want to get to know more about this continent by visitting different nations. I want to start going to countries where people are really friendly but I am not sure which one visit first. I thought I could start off through Portugal, then Spain, France, Romania...and then I go up. I don't have much money, I also need to figure out a way to keep travelling and return to Brazil. When my visa is renovated and my job allows me to travel, I would do so. I would love to make new friends and meet/talk to people who would be interested in chatting about their countries, languages and cultures. Places to visit,etc. I am also learning French and other languages. I want to learn basic Italian and my biggest challenge is German because it is really different from my mother tongue language which is Portuguese, plus a language that many European countries speak to, I believe that speaking a local language or at least a few sentences is a good way to know more about the people. Well, for now I would be very pleased if you could talk about your country and be friends with me. In exchange, I can talk about South America and Brazil in general. Just hit me up if you are interested in chatting and making a new friend who is just passionate about travelling, just like you. I look forward to talking to you.

I'm wondering if anyone here can comment from experience. does transport and hotel booking work (I'm looking at the land based trip not the cruise). Does Tauck just shuttle you to the hotel and the room is already booked and they just give you the room key? Is there one ""master guide"" who will be in charge of keeping everyone on time and getting everyone to meetup? Will it be via phone texting? does dress code work exactly? I'm not the fanciest person, so I normally don't bring suits or even dressy clothes on vacation. That said we are going to some nice places on this tour, and some pictures I've seen people seem to be dressd up. Interesting planning for a 13 day trip and getting dress clothes into your bag and not wrinkly.....? guessing the average age is older, retired couples, based on teh videos I found. we are on the opposite end of the spectrum from that demographic.. I can't imagine this being a deal breaker but I'm wondering if any young couples ever go on these tours for any info from your experiences.",1

480,"Spirit Airlines, Big Front Seat info for fat peopleHi, Reddit.
If I had a blog, I'd put this there.  I don't, and that's why I'm leaving this here. is just info for anyone wanting to find out more about Spirit Airlines Big Front Seats. wanted to find out this info before I took my trip, and couldn't find the answers anywhere. Now when someone does a search, this post will pop up. am a huge person.
I am 5'9"" tall.  
I don't want to type on here how much I weigh, but it's a lot lot lot.  I'm definitely one of the fattest people you'll see walking around.  No exaggeration. recently decided to fly to Vegas.  I did not want to encroach on anyone sitting next to me, so did a lot of research on seat sizes.  It looked to me like Spirit Airlines Big Front Seat would be big enough for me, so I booked it. answer:  It was big enough!!! of the seats have airbags.  Don't book those.  The belt buckle will not meet if you have a massive waist like mine.  If in doubt, don't.  I thought I'd be able to buckle the belt with the airbag because I can still get the seatbelts in cars to click if I squirm and squeeze enough.  Nope.  Too short.  The seatbelt extender I bought on amazon and brought along on the flight worked on the non-airbag seats, but the airbag seat buckle had been modified specifically so an extender could not be attached. front-est seats on Spirit do have slightly more legroom and are easiest to get into.  But if you're a fat person like me, book the ""Big Front Seat"" farther back that doesn't have the airbag seatbelt.  The advantage of the ""big front seat"" that's in the 2nd or 4th row in the plane (or whatever) is that there is room there for you to keep your bag with you rather than having to put it in the overhead. No bags are allowed in the front-est seats. Big front Seats are two seats side by side.  I chose a window seat, and was glad I did.  There was plenty of room between me and the window for my arm fat to drape over, and I was not crowded. the side with the shared armrest, I would've been taking about 3/4 of the armrest if I had just sat normally. I did not want to encroach, though, so brought along a belt to loop around that arm & my torso to tie it in closer.  That way I could still rest, but my arm was held inside my own ""zone"" of space. legs were no problem.  I wasn't sure if there'd be enough leg room not to encroach, but there was a big plenty.  No problem at all. There were also extra inches between my knees and the seat in front of me, so I would think even if you're huge like me, you'd still fit in the seat if you're 6'5.   I think if you were skinny (no big butt) you'd probably still have leg room even if you're a seven-footer.  Here's a warning for you: I booked my round trip ticket, I picked a Big front Seat and paid for it.  Golden, right?  Not so much.  When I printed my boarding pass the morning of the trip, the flight to Vegas had me listed for the big front seat, but the return boarding pass had me assigned to one of the seats farther back. course there's no way I'd fit. called Spirit in a panic and actually got through to someone.
She couldn't assign me a big front seat, they were all sold.  She couldn't sell me two seats, the plane was full. ended up booking me in a ""priority"" seat. It's a seat with armrests that lift & that are set aside for people traveling with pets.  I was told the seat had more room than other three-per-row seats, and it was the best they could do. on the return flight and **it was bad.**
I came nowhere near fitting in that priority seat.  There was no extra room between me and the window as there had been in the big front seat. I was encroaching on my neighbor A LOT. It felt like I was encroaching 1/2 of their seat, and maybe I was.
 I couldn't even move in the seat to put my bag on the floor. 
My knees were jammed up tight into the seat in front of me. The seats are thin. Must've been miserable for that person, as well. the flight had been delayed, and some people had decided to make other arrangements. The flight was no longer full. The couple who'd been assigned the seats next to me were able to shift to a private row where they were all alone, too.  This meant I had three seats to spread out in.  Honestly, I needed them.  I could've made do with 2, but having three allowed me to spread out my knees and be comfortable. There wouldn't have been sufficient knee room if I were limited to two seats - the person in front of me would've felt my knee in their back.
Turned out to be a great trip.
I'll happily fly Spirit again.
Next time, I'm gonna make darn sure I have confirmation that I'm booked in that big front seat both going and coming as soon as I book the tickets.  I think it was a glitch in their ap, and I'm hoping they have it fixed, soon.  Do take the time to call & stay on hold to confirm you're in the big front seat both ways.
Pitch.
The pitch of the big front seat was comfy for me. No worries.
The pitch of the three-per-row seats was lowsy. Backache within 1/2 hour.   for reading.
I'm not on reddit often, anymore, so please forgive if you ask a question in the comments or messages and I don't get back to you promptly.  I will answer when I can.
Happy travels.",1

Weather is something Im unsure of, as he has lived all his life in a tropical climate but hotter the better (comparatively). Would enjoy both nature and modern city. Not interested in museums or history. He loves Animals especially Farm ones like Cows. Upto 2grand! (Lower the better). Dallas. other than California as we have plans of visiting there for NYE.

536,"Help Requested: I am really struggling to complete my Mediterranean [Milan, Valencia, Lisbon ... ?] itinerary (Lots of details in the comments)Hello r/travel, would love your help. am a solo traveler who is planning a November trip to Southern Europe. I love traveling **so much** but feel a bit overwhelmed by a lot of great (and good) options and cannot seem to move forward with a decision. Here are the constraints/limitations I am working with: of time: 14 - 15 days (not including travel days to and from Europe) Very strongly prefer to be in warmer climates
   * I am from a cold climate, so want as much of a break from the cold if possible
* I am a lover of languages and have been ramping up my French studies, so a warm place where I could practice French would be awesome, too.
* I have traveled quite a bit, so I feel pretty confident I can make use of good deals to find affordable-but-comfortable lodging. I would not say I'm hardcore budget traveling -- but I would rather do more in cheaper places than less in hyper expensive places. Please share your tips with me though.
* I prefer city exploration to hiking.
* Cities with great (safe and expansive) public transportation would be awesome -- I do not want to rent a car unless I have to.
* When I travel, I want to just sort of go with the specific city's flow and get a glimpse of normal life there. I will of course try to see the biggest must-sees, but would prefer to get that out of the way in a day or two. I am not interested in going to Hard Rock cafes or visiting anything that is overwhelmingly bustling with tourists (ex. SF's Fisherman's Wharf, Barcelona's Les Rambles, Ontario's Niagara Falls tourist area, and NY's Times Square would be examples of places I would probably not choose to visit.)
* LGBTQ-friendly locations preferred, but not necessary. Itinerary So Far:** Lisbon (4-5 days): I studied abroad in Southern Europe and always dreamed of visiting Lisbon but was not able to make it there during that time. **This is the only absolute must-see on my list.** and it will be one of the longer amounts of time I stay in one place.
* Valencia (3 days): I have heard great things about Valencia, but my main motivation is spending a long weekend there to visit friends. (I have been to Spain in the past.)
* Milan (3 days): Similarly, my main motivation is spending a long weekend there to visit friends. (I have never been to Italy before.) that, I would have about 5 - 5.5 consecutive days that I currently have no idea what to do with.** I mention the places I have considered, I want to give you a heads up about ***a few places I will likely NOT go.*** (They are places I adore, but that I know well enough that I would like to see new things instead of returning): Amsterdam
* Barcelona
* Berlin
* London
* Madrid
   * (I would go to Madrid for a day or two if it made connecting flights and things easier for other legs of travel. I have a few friends in Madrid, but am not a huge fan of the city if I am honest.)
* Prague what to do with the remaining days?** all that I have mentioned so far, I would love your opinions about how to round out my itinerary. I am absolutely open to your suggestions For your reference, here are a few places I have considered but am on the fence about (in no particular order): Porto: I hear so many great things about Portugal. I have heard more great things about Lisbon, but I mean -- if I am in the area, it could be a great city to explore.
* Marseille: My sense is that this is a love it/hate it sort of city. Could tick of my ""Place to practice French"" goal
* Paris: I've been before and it was the coldest (not coolest) trip I have ever taken. It's maybe the most expensive place I would be willing to go. It's definitely tempting -- especially because it has a huge LGBTQ community. But I think a part of me is hoping to be inspired to go somewhere else, if I can. It definitely is hard to take Paris off the list.
* Fez, Morocco: I have never been to North Africa and would love to go. I think everyone has a favorite city but so far I think that the reviews I have read make me think Fez would be my preferred. I am open to your suggestions though.
* Athens: Is just a random outlier geographically, but one that a couple of friends have been very adamant that I consider. It would be the farthest East I would be willing to go during this trip (I spent a lot of time debating Istanbul & Tel Aviv, but decided to save those trips for a time in the future when there is some improvement in the domain of human rights issues.) Athens does not read super contemporary city to me and I am a fan of trendy cities. I am just not sure if I should try to make Athens happen during this trip or save it for later. It would check marks related to temperature and culture, but I am not sure what the social experience of the city is like -- metro access, etc. have thought about: Doing 2 days in Morocco then maybe hitting a couple cities in France before flying back to the U.S
* Just rounding out the trip in Paris, or
* Or just doing Porto
* Or only doing Athens I am at an impasse that I can't seem to overcome on my own. So, if you have any tips, insights, tricks, or suggestions I am all ears. **Thank you for your help everyone!** -- A wordy, indecisive traveler can't figure out where to visit in Europe/North Africa and wants your help to solve this puzzle.*",1

We booked a flight to NYC (we are from Europe) and are planning to hire a car and do a round trip for exactly 2 weeks (14.12.-28.12.). Ive been looking for itineraries but most people seem to do this in summer so it's not really the same. I have been to NYC before, my partner hasnt. were thinking of the following route: NYC - (possibly a stop on the way, if there is a nice place) - Niagara - Toronto - Montreal - (Ottawa if its worth it) - Quebec (maybe spend our Christmas, 24 Dec, there) - Boston- (fly out of NCY on 28 Dec). anyone done a similar route in the winter? Is it too ambitious (getting bored very easily but also dont want to rush it)? we are looking for are recommendations on how much time we should spend where and if there are any cool places around (its so hard to find this out if you dont know what to look for). We thought NYC would be nice for the Christmas spirit but we rather not spend too much time in cities (we would like to pass through them though and spend a night in each if recommendable, I guess at least 3 in NYC). We are very spoilt with what we have seen/visited so far and are very hard to impress, but are there any extraordinary sites that you can recommend? We are not so much into museums and historic places, more into natural beauty and unique experiences. E.g. I was trying to find an elk farm along the way.... do you have any recommendations on where to spend Christmas eve? We thought about Quebec, only because it looks like a ""cozy"" town. Or do you know any special places that you can recommend? spa hotels, lodges, etc.? budget is average Id say. would really appreciate your help. thanks in advance!",1

* Experiencing local culture
* Drinking good beer
* Appalachia (maybe a day hiking in the Smokies)
* Bluegrass we'd like to avoid: Spending more than $100/night on accommodation for the two of us

* Civil War history (it's of little interest) don't think I want to drive the whole distance from New Orleans to DC so I thought we could fly to Atlanta (MSY-ATL direct isn't expensive) and start the road trip from there, taking a winding route to visit a few places along the way to DC.

654,Cinque Terre - closed trails?So Im gonna visit Italy in one week and still have some open questions regarding Cinque Terre: We (family with 2 kids who are 12 & 17 years old) plan to visit the Cinque Terre National Park and heard about a day ticket that allows us to use the trains & hiking paths in the region. Is it possible to buy that ticket at the train station in La Spezia?  I think we wont be able to visit every terre/town. Is there a town we absolutely have to see or are there multiple towns that we could easily visist throughout one day?  Saw some posts where the hiking trails seemed to be closed. Are there any particular information about which trails are closed/accessible? ,1

Its for someone else and has Delhi, India as the final stop.

We live in Toronto, Ontario and our trip will be from December 21st to December 30th, with us having booked accommodations in Orlando from the 23rd to 29th. We are a group of 5, all adults over 21. budget is about 2-3000 CAD (1500-2300 USD). Most of our accommodations are booked already and gas is budgeted, so those arent included. We will be booking 3 more times, but plan on booking in the cheapest motels we can find. We are debating on driving through Kentucky/Tennessee/Georgia or through Pennsylvania/Virigina/Carolinas. We have family in Kentucky and Tennesee, but half of them are out of town when we are driving down. ***As such, we wanted to know what route would make for the most interesting road trip?*** a little aside, my girlfriend is mixed race and I am white. My cousins in Kentucky have said that it ""should be fine"", however she is alittle worried. I would love if someone from these states could put her mind at ease. Her Trinidadian side of the family are filling her head with nonsense, as they did when we went to Mexico. ***We are planning on spending two nights on our way down and were wondering if there were any half day attractions that are MUST sees?*** America is massive, full of awesome adventures, and we are having a hard time finding things to go see. Some more information, my mom has trouble with her joints so the stuff that instantly excites me and my two brothers is a no go for her unfortunately. I think that these will be the deciding factor on our trip down. FOOD! Everytime I've been to the states, I am blown away by the food. ***Is there any food stops on our trip down that are MUSTs?*** We have 1 vegetarian in our group but we can send him out to graze (in all seriousness hes super picky and will probably just order from some generic fast food place). We are using two of our 5 free days in Orlando to go to DisneyWorld, and are debating on going to Gatorland. ***Again, we are all adults over 21, what are some attractions in Orlando that are fun for a family of adults?*** I know the nightlife is great, and I'm sure my brothers, girlfriend and I will go out one night but we need something to do as a family. There is a chance I will need to fly down the 24th and leave the 29th for work. ***If anyone has advice on when to book plane tickets, that would be great.*** I'm debating on whether booking as soon as I've confirmed I have to fly down, or if I should wait until November to see if prices go down. The other say I saw tickets for 450 CAD, but today they are 706 CAD round trip.  really appreciate your time reading this post. This is probably our last big family trip, as all of us boys are starting to save to move out, so my mom wanted to make it special. I apologize if I've asked any questions previously asked, I just wanted to be able to communicate with people from the area to get more local knowledge of what's worth while and what's a tourist trap. Thank you again.  Ontario family of 5 all older than 21.

772,"Should I move to Cork, Ireland for 1 year?Hello, love for others perspectives to weigh in on an upcoming decision I need to make by Monday. Friday my boss approached me and informed me of an opportunity to move to Cork, Ireland for 1 year. Id be doing the same job, my transportation and rent would be paid for. Id likely be able to ship whatever I wanted aside from large furniture. Possessions in the states would likely be put into storage on company dime.  feels like a big decision to make by Monday! Nonetheless, I need to make it. I live in the Bay Area, I am not from here. All my family resides in Colorado so nothing really changes for them. Im currently single, turning 28 this week.  can think of four major benefits to this:
1.	Professional Gains: Id be in pseudo leadership position, helping to startup a new lab there. While I wouldnt be an actual manager I think Id be positioned as a mentoring engineering. I have been with my company for almost 6 years, however, I am very new in my current role. Only been in the role of an engineer for 6 months, so Im not terribly experienced yet (I was shocked I was even asked). 
2.	Financial Gains: If I socked away the money Id be spending on rent instead, I would be able to save tens of thousands of dollars.
3.	Personal Growth: Ive never lived in another country... never even traveled to another country, ha! So this decision seems a little daunting. Im certainly not opposed to traveling outside the US, it just has happened yet. So just like my move from CO to CA was different, life changing, and gave my new perceptive, I assume moving to a new culture will be all of that even more amped up.
4.	I may never get another opportunity like this again. I could spend a trip around the sun in Ireland! That sounds really cool. Like something I would always reflect on and remember fondly for the rest of my life. can only think of one major downside:
1.	I would be leaving my friends/community I have built up here. Only temporarily, though, of course. But still, it could feel very isolating to move to a new country and know absolutely nobody. I had a couple friends when I moved to the Bay Area so that was extremely helpful. This time, itd be 100% on my own.  am I not considering? Both good and bad? Cork seems like a great place to live. It seems like Ireland is pretty free from conflict. Cork is supposedly a very safe place to live, free from majority of crimes with the exception of a higher than normal homicide rate.  are your thoughts?",1

I'm going to be staying for two months, I think it's very unlikely I'll need medical assistance but I would like to be insured to be Emergency medical transport & repatriation, so if something does go seriously wrong I can be sent back to Australia for free public health. I think the most likely reason why I'd need a hospital is if I am injured by a car somehow. I don't plan to drive myself but others will be driving me. So having some sort of insurance for ambulance and emergency life threatening cover is appealing. else that I'm offered I don't care much for. I don't want travel insurance or things like lose of income insurance, I just want emergency health insurance. The deals I'm seeing offered are all between $332-$447, which is quite expensive to me, so I'm hoping I can find a cheaper deal with less coverage. ask an ignorant question, should I book insurance with an Australian company, because I'm an Australian citizen, or should I book with a USA company, because I'm traveling to USA? Or does this not matter? am I supposed to go about finding credible medical insurance deals? Most information out there seems to be catered towards Americans. I'm not sure if that matters. Lots of the insurance websites I stumble across will only offer me a quote if my residence is in USA.

897,"4 Night Stay JerusalemThis was mine and wife's first trip to Israel/Middle East.  Everything was booked by us and not part of a Tour Group fair amount of research went into the trip i.e. places to stay, places to see, transport etc.  However lots more could have been done as always.  
It started with an overnight flight from London Luton to Ben Gurion Airport.  Landed about 5:30 am, so had the whole first day to explore and rest a bit. to Jerusalem from the airport was easy.  We got the train, which only took about 20 minutes.  Was cheap and quick.  The train stop at the airport was well sign posted, so easy to find.  Trains are comfortable and at that time fairly empty. stop in Jerusalem was at the Central Bus Station.  Then Light Train to Damascus Gate and then a 15 minute walk to the hotel. thing that we noticed (apart from the heat) was seemed like everyone was carrying guns.  Being from the UK, we see our police with them occasionally, but soldiers and police not even on duty carry them to and from work over there.  the hotel.  Got there well before check-in time, but were able to leave our bags, get changed and have an Arabic Coffee. coffee was a wander round the Old City, half in a daze due to no sleep in about 24 hours, so didn't really take it all in.  just marvelling at all the sites, narrow streets, shops etc.  Spent a good few hours round there but knew we were also going to explore it properly in the following days. to Hotel.  The hotel was in the middle of being refurbished, so was a bit tatty looking.  Nothing really bad, but did need a tidy up and lick of paint.  Room was comfortable and clean.  So no complaints about the hotel.  Was just what we needed. Hotel is in an Arabic Area of Jerusalem, so the store around it have their goods out, lots of small shops and market stalls, so easy to pick up some snacks when we wanted.  Plenty of cafes about as well for food in the evening.  These were mainly kebab places, which was fine for us.    
The hotel supplied a buffet breakfast which catered for most tastes.  It was great, but when you have to accommodate different nationalities and religions, you can only do so much to try and please people without having to through a ton of food away each day.  
There is also a rooftop restaurant, which gave fantastic views over the Old City and Temple Mount.  the food in the restaurant was fairly decent.  One thing we did notice though, was that where ever we ate, if we had a starter and main course, then they would either come at same time or very soon after one another.    
The cocktails in the restaurant bar were very good, but like most alcohol over in Israel, were expensive.  2 - Friday  this was a Friday we planned a trip to the Israeli Museum in the morning as it was closing in the afternoon. a fascinating place.  Lots of history about the whole middle east, from the beginnings of civilisation through to more modern times.  There were also a few other exhibitions that we didn't look around, but perhaps would have if had a bit more time. museum also holds the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Aleppo Codex.  Which were really good to see and read the history of them.  
Lunch that day was in a place just opposite Mahane Yehuda Market.  This was one of the gems of our stay.  Fantastic market selling all different things - herbs, spices, fish, meat, fruit.  Lots of cakes as well.  Just walking around the place was a joy to behold.  All the different smells from all the produce.  We had a great Ice Cream Waffle at Gelato Aldo.  the Waffle you got to choose the Ice Cream, fruit, toppings, sauces etc.  It was huge, but just what we needed after a few hours walking round in the heat. then went for a walk near the hotel to see the Garden of Gethsemane, Tomb of the Virgin and Grotto of Gethsemane.  All very significant sites during the time of Jesus.  I'm not religious, but walking in these places that are mentioned in History a couple of thousand years ago, does have and effect on you, even from a historical point of view.   try to have a look at the church of Mary Magdalene, however it was shut, and only open on Tuesdays and Thursdays for a couple of hours in the morning. 3- Saturday was booked for this day, seeing Bethlehem, Jericho and Dead Sea.  This was booked with Tourist Israel.  There was a bit of confusion at the pick up point and lot of people loitering trying to find out where to go as the instructions just said 'Meet outside hotel'.  Great apart form this hotel where we had to meet was the King David Hotel and is the meeting point for lots of tour groups.  I have feed this back to them, so hopefully will improve this for future trips. stop was along the Peace/Security Wall to see the Banksy Hotel and the murals along the wall. was on to Bethlehem proper and to Church of the Nativity where Jesus was born.  Like most churches of significance in Bethlehem and Jerusalem, it is split into different denominations - Greek Orthodox,  Armenian, Catholic, each with there own section of the church and orders in the running of the churches.  Due to the queues we weren't able to see the Grotto where Jesus was born.   Bethlehem was onto Jericho for lunch.  For those that don;t know much about Israel and the West Bank, the West Bank is split in to 3 different areas, A,B and C.  Area C  is under Israeli Control for security and Administration.  Area B is Israeli Security, Palestinian Administration.  Area A is Palestinian Security and Administration. you arrive near Jericho, there is a large sign announcing that it is in Area and no Israeli citizens are allowed. was just a simple buffet affair.   it was on to the Monastery of Temptation.  Wife and I didn't actually go up there as wife doesn't like cable cars, so we just chilled in very welcome air conditioned room with some soda. it was onto the Dead Sea - Lowest Land Point on Earth.  Somewhere my wife was looking very much to enjoying the experience.    
However when we got there it was packed and I mean really packed.  To go in it, you have to go to these resort areas and the amount of the Dead Sea that you can 'swim' in is very small for the amount of people there.  
Anyway we eventually got in the Dead Sea ( walking down to it, you can really see how much it has reduced in size and depth).  I got in and laid on back floating away, relaxing, rubbing the mud on me to cleanse the skin etc.  Wife got in and floated a bit, but struggled to get back up and in process lost her prescription sun glasses.  Unfortunately we couldn't find them either, so that put a damper on the experience for her.  tour was effectively a brief look at the places to give you a glimpse of them.   There was an issue when leaving the dead sea as you changed coaches depending where you were going back to.  There was no organisation telling people what coach to get on and with the number of coaches at the resort was a case of just wander up and down them to find out which one to get on.  Again this was mentioned to the travel company, so hopefully will improve. 4 - Sunday  day round the Old City got up earlyish as we wanted to make sure we got to visit Temple Mount as know that there are sometimes issues getting up there.  
Now to get there you have to go through a security checkpoint at the Dung Gate, which is also one of the main entrances to the Western Wall.  The entrance to Temple Mount is on the far right hand side of the security check points to the Western Wall and is called the Mugrabi Gate.  It is just a small portacabin for the security check point, then up a wooden bridge to the Temple Mount.  
First thing that struck me up there was how huge it is and also how peaceful it is up there compared to the hustle and bustle of the Old City.  
Wandering round Temple Mount and looking at the Dome of the Rock you can see the ornate decorations round the outside.  There was a door that was left ajar in Dome of the Rock, so you could look in.  Again the inside was very ornately decorated could have spent so much time up on Temple Mount, but had other places to visit.  It really is a fantastic place and one of the best places we visited in Jerusalem. was Via Dolorosa and Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Dolorosa is the name of the streets that Jesus took his last steps and at the end is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  
Along the Via Dolorosa are the Stations of the Cross.  Each Station signifies a moment that happened on His last walk i.e. Where He was condemned to death, where he was flogged, where he saw he mother, where he was laid on the cross etc.  were lots of Pilgrim Groups along this walk ( as expected), with one group carrying a cross.   This is all fine, and good to see lots of people exercising their faith.  However the crowds, the heat, the narrow streets etc, it can be a bit of a pain if you get caught up in one of these groups when you are just taking your time taking in the whole atmosphere (of which the tour groups are also part of). we got to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the entrance looked small.  However when went in, the church just opens up inside and is huge.  Just wandering around the church was a sight to behold.  All the worshippers and pilgrims going about seeing doing what they needed/wanted to do.  Each section of the church had it's own unique point.  There are a number of coves to go in as well as a section upstairs, which is where Jesus was on the cross.  This also gave you a view of the church and the people queuing to touch the place where Jesus rose from the dead.    
It really is hard to describe how big and how special this church feels.  
 the church was lunch at Panoramic Golden City.  This restaurant has a roof top area giving views over the old city, serving standard Jerusalem fair of humus, kebabs etc.  Gave us a nice place to rest our legs.  Food was ok.   Views were fantastic. lunch was the Western Wall and Western Wall Tunnels tour.  
Back through more security checks to get to the Western Wall.  The site of seeing all the people praying at the Wall was a site to behold.  I didn't realise that the prayer area was sectioned off, with a smaller area for the women.  Western Wall Tunnels Tour took you though the tunnels along the side of the Western Wall.    
It gave you the history of the Wall and we saw some of the archaeological digs that are still taking place to find out more about the history.  They have currently dug about 35 feet below the ground level and are still not at the bottom of the foundations.  That just goes to show how much the City has risen over the years.  This also helps explain how the historical version of Jesus was crucified on a hill outside the Old City Walls (at the time the old city was a lot smaller), even though it now days the walk up the old city paths does seem to be only a bit of an uphill walk, when back then it would have been a lot of a bigger hill to walk up from the then street level.  
Again there was a lot of history explained about the Wall and also how the tunnels were used for water storage in the old days.    
 know that this is a long trip report.  I have covered the majority of things I felt needed covering.  I all honesty I could write a lot lot more about the place. never felt unsafe whilst we were there. Public transport is cheap and easy to use.   
Jerusalem has a lot of security, but that is understandable.  
The Old City is mad crazy, but so good.  The maze of streets allowing you to find little gems of places.  
 we go back there,  yes we certainly would, hopefully in a few years time.",1

935,"9 day June Honeymoon to Bali vs. Caribbean for $6k budgetI'm planning my honeymoon next year for June, and am split between Bali vs. somewhere in the Caribbean (most likely St. Lucia and Barbados). My fiancee and I are interested in the adventurous aspects of things, e.g. snorkeling, zip lining, hiking, caves, etc but would also like some nice beaches. We both want to visit Southeast Asia in general as we've never been, but we're worried that it won't be enough time to really be worth the length of the trip there. I'm also worried that the budget won't be quite enough to make it a worthwhile honeymoon; we don't need the height of luxury but would want to spend at least the first few nights in a nice resort. On the other hand, I'm concerned that the Caribbean might be a bit underwhelming.  anyone been to both destinations and do you have any advice on things to consider?",1

939,"I have an EU passport, 5000 and up to 7 months of free time to spend traveling through Europe. I want to live and work in cities. What should I know in advance?Hi, 18 year old Irish gap year student here, planning to travel through Europe for anywhere from 3-7 months before beginning college. The trip starts in January in the Netherlands. I would like to live and work in at least 2 major cities during this time (if possible), but I have some things that I want to better understand first.  is roughly the shortest duration that an average employer (in the service industry) wants a person to stay in their city for, in order to give them a job?  is the most feasible form of accommodation for such a stay? Presumably it is not cost effective to live in a hostel for a month, but is there a better option? Would an apartment take a tenant that is only staying for a month (or whatever amount of time you give as the answer to the question above)? lot of people speak of wages from service industry jobs as being quite poor, and forcing one to live Hand to mouth. If I cook for myself, and dont go out too often and take other similar frugal measures, am I likely to have a good time while living abroad on such low-pay jobs?  details/actions must I plan/perform in advance for a trip of this kind? I am happy to embrace flexibility and spontaneity but I dont want to be foolish/naive and leave the wrong things to chance, since I do hope to secure work in some places.  and all opinions and advice is hugely appreciated. I have searched previous posts for relevant information but have not found enough. Thank you! I do not have any special skills to offer but I have restaurant experience and have until December to take on a barista/bartending course or something similar if that would be of benefit.)",1
940,"I need help decided between the DR and somewhere in EuropeSo originally I thought I had enough money to do both trips but I dont. Now I have to decide  Trip: its a mission trip. Ive been on it about 5 years. I do enjoy the people that come on it. Most are my sisters friends and since she hates when I talk to them this is basically the only time I get to actually socialize with them. However if we look at it from a romantic point of view things between me and any of her friends are and will always be platonic.  trip: So Im looking at 3 different options. Budapest, Minsk and Paris. I will be staying in one of these cities. I have been to Paris and enjoyed the city.  have never been to Minsk or Budapest but both look lovely.  we look through a romantic scope here the possibilities are endless.  it really comes down to if the Dominican trip is a safe bet. I know what will happen. I will do about 5 hours of physical work during the week. The rest of the time will be spend visiting sites, hanging out with people and getting drunk Minsk or Budapest will be unscripted and something knew. It will also be my first time solo travelling which given that I was nervous about leading a a children focused floor hockey program today may not be the best choice.  think too much about the romantic scope of things. Its basically just pointing out the Dominican trip is a mission trip with friends where as any of the European cities trip is wide open",1

972,Identifying Pins or PatchesWhen I am looking at videos on YouTube I often see people have patches of where theyve been on their luggage or a little pin of where their from. I thought it was a cute idea so I was considering buying a little bag of Canadian flag pins for when I go off on a backpacking trip around Europe. One to wear on my pack and a few extras to give away to people who I befriend along the way. This was a cute idea until I realized it would be branding myself a tourist everywhere I go.  I know that carrying around a day bag and taking pictures of things will likely make me stick out like a sore thumb anyways.. but would you skip the pin and patches? Does it not matter? What do you guys think?,1

Days in Zagreb, 3 Days Split, 3 Days Hvar are now thinking of doing Portugal instead of Croatia as we have similar interest in visiting and travel would be significantly easier (direct flight from Italy, direct flight home) and we would most likely do 8-9 days split between Lisbon and Porto.

992,"Everything You Need to Know about the Ecuadorian Crisis Before You Visit*It is October 11th, 2019 and I have been in Ecuador for a little under two weeks. Unfortunately, only two of those days have consisted of actual exploring as the country is currently paralyzed by violent protests and a national strike (El Paro Nacional) led by Confederacin de Nacionalidades Indgenas del Ecuador (CONAIE). The events have left me pretty much stuck in Otavalo, a town about 2 hours north of Quito (Ecuadors capital) as roadblocks have been setup throughout throughout Imburara Province by protesting indigenous groups. I originally wasnt going to write about this until after things have settled down but I think its important to put pen to paper while living in the moment. When I first arrived, I honestly didnt know much about what was going on as I hadnt read up on Ecuadors history prior to visiting the country. However, 8 days of reading local news (*[*El Comercio*]( following Ecuadorian Twitter trends, and witnessing protests live have allowed me to write more intelligently on this topic.* Correa-** In order to understand what is going on now, one must consider the dynamics behind Ecuadorian politics. From 2007-2017, Rafael Correa was the president of Ecuador. He was a self-professed democratic socialist who aligned himself with left-wing leaders such as Hugo Chavez (Venezuela), Fidel Castro (Cuba), and Evo Morales (Bolivia). Despite being a mestizo (mixed), he was beloved by Ecuadors mostly indigenous lower class as he used the countries oil wealth to fund various social programs and subsidies. Correa also took a confrontational approach towards western states (the United States) and institutions (World Bank and International Monetary Fund). In 2012, Correa went as far as allowing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to hide in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United Kingdom after WikiLeaks made public thousands of US government classified documents, severely damaging US national security. Despite antagonizing the regional superpower and rebuffing world economic institutions, petrodollars and tourism allowed Correa to implement policies which decreased poverty and slightly increase Ecuadors GDP during his tenure making him even more popular. Ecuadorian Elections-** By the end of 2016, Ecuador had entered into a national recession due to international sanctions, the declining price of oil, and exorbitant public spending. After serving 3 terms, Rafael Correa was not eligible for re-election and thus, Ecuador would vote for a new president in the 2017 General Elections. During Correas first two terms as President (2007-2013), he chose Lenin Moreno to be vice-President. Moreno  was a lifelong paraplegic due to being shot in a botched robbery attempt 1998. During his time as vice-president, Moreno was a fierce advocate for people with disabilities earning a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012. Lenin Moreno left the vice-presidency in 2013, taking a position with the United Nations as Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility. However, Lenin Moreno returned to Ecuador in 2016 to run for president. Given their past relationship and seemingly similar ideology (center-left democratic socialist), Moreno was endorsed by outgoing Rafael Correa who still maintained widespread popularity despite the countrys economic struggles. Correas endorsement proved to be significant as Lenin Moreno barely won the presidency over Guillermo Lasso by less than 3% in the second round of Ecuadorian elections in April 2017. Pivot**\- This is where things start to get messy. Despite receiving Correas endorsement, Lenin Moreno began reversing many of his former bosses policies once he assumed office. Through a referendum, he was able to scrap various pieces of legislation that targeted wealthy individuals and big banks. He also eliminated any chance of Correa possibly being re-elected president by overturning another referendum which would have allowed individuals to run for president as many times as possible. Recently, Moreno allowed British officials into Londons Ecuadorian Embassy to arrest Julian Assange, who had been living there for 7 years. Now seen as more of a right-wing conservative, Morenos ideological pivot sparked an intense feud with Correa in which a warrant was issued for Correas arrest on corruption/kidnapping charges. Rafael Correa fled to Belgium where he currently lives in exile and continues vocally criticize Morenos policies. For those that arent aware, Ecuador is a predominantly indigenous society composed of 11 different cultures (Quichaua, Saraguros, Slasacas, Otavalenos, Huaorani, Cofan, Siona, Achuar, Shuar, Zaparo and Secoya). The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), formed in 1986, is the most powerful indigenous organization in the country which represents the interests of most of the countrys indigenous groups. While not part of the government, the organization has arguably equal influence over Ecuadorian society. In fact, CONAIE led protests have led to the removal of three Ecuadorian presidents. CONAIE advocates for policies that improve agriculture, indigenous rights, and fair distribution of land. To be successful in Ecuadorian politics, one must maintain a working relationship with the organization at every level. Reforms**\- Firmly established as an economic conservative, Lenin Moreno began to take measures in order to revive Ecuadors stagnant economy. One of the more obvious fixes was to drastically reduce social spending. In February 2019, Lenin Moreno accepted loan in excess of 10 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank which put international pressure on him to adopt such policies. After barely winning the presidency and having lost a good portion of his support due to his feud with Rafael Correa, Lenin needed to be strategic about how he would implement his austerity measures. Unfortunately, he decided for the more heavy handed approach by introducing several laws at once which would cut various programs and subsidies. The austerity measures included cutting government fuel subsidies (doubling the price of gas), slashing vacation days for government workers in half (30 to 15) and requiring government workers to forfeit one day of salary to the government per month. Strike**\- Naturally Ecuadorian citizens where surprised by the severity and swiftness of the economic measures. The first group to take action was the countrys transportation union which declared a national transportation strike on October 3rd due to the removal of fuel subsidies. Removal of fuel subsidies would result in higher operational costs for transportation companies due to increased cost of fuel. In a normal capitalist society, a company would just pass the cost onto the consumer by raising prices. However, Ecuadors system makes it illegal for companies to raise prices in Ecuador without government approval. As a result of the strike, transportation throughout the country was halted which brought everyday people into the streets to protest. Lenin Moreno would react by declaring a state of emergency (estado de excepcin) for 60 days in which the military was deployed throughout the country to quash discontent. Paro Nacional-** Given the militarys heavy handed approach to obtaining order and the suppression of certain freedoms due to the state of emergency, to some it soon became more than fighting about fuel subsidies. Despite the government allowing the transportation union to raise prices which would end the transportation strike, Morenos initial handling of the situation had proved to be a tipping point for a frustrated population in which his popularity had been declining. At the same moment the transportation union held a press conference announcing the end of their strike, CONAIE began to call for a continuation of the protest from various groups (students/indigenous groups/union leaders). El Paro Nacional has continued to paralyze the country. While the government has attempted to restore order to the country, many cities remain on lockdown and it is practically impossible to travel between cities at this moment due to roadblocks throughout the country. Situation**\-On October 9th, thousands of indigenous protestors arrived in Quito after several days of marching throughout the country. In anticipation of their arrival, Lenin Moreno has moved the government from Quito to the city of Guayaquil, along the southern coast. The protestors have camped out in the Quitos historical center and continue to call for the repeal of Morenos economic measures. CONAIE has specifically taken exception to the government agreeing to the IMF loans (and the conditions they entail) without being consulted. Protests continue daily across the country (including here in Otavalo) as people now are calling for Moreno to step down. For now, Moreno maintains the support of the military which is why he is holding firm in his stance. Protestors have reacted by capturing several police officers and attempting to take over government facilities (including the National Assembly). Lenin has gone as far as accusing both Rafael Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of orchestrating a coup attempt. When it looked like the situation may have gotten calmer, one of the leaders of CONAIE was killed during a protest on October 10th which has galvanized the protestors. The government had previously introduced an agricultural reform package without reinstating the fuel subsidies but CONAIE doesnt seem to keen on accepting it. As I sit in my hotel on Day 8 of El Paro Nacional, stuck in Otavalo, both sides remain in a deadlock. As a result, many store owners are scared to open their businesses, children are unable to go to school, and tourists remain stuck in various cities throughout the country. There was discontent long brewing against current President Lenin Moreno due to his rapid reversal of previous president Rafeal  Correa's socialist policies (after being endorsed by Corea). Current protests were initially led by transportation union due to removal of fuel subsidies. Now the countries, largest indigenous group (CONAIE) has taken over protests. The protests are ongoing with each side entrenched with their position. Would not recommend travel at this time.

I'm referencing Mexico in this case as I live here but this dumb design flaw exists all over the world and certainly up & down Latin America. believe that the ""saves money on property taxes"" story is mostly a myth and the theory that your house is ""ready for a 2nd"" floor is heavily flawed, too...for one, the rebar rusts and the rust follows the steel into your structure causing damage and 95% of the buildings you see with rebar sticking up out of the roof will never see another floor. literally SAVES you money to cut off the rebar before you pour the roof and then your house looks SO much nicer, even if you keep it cinder block gray. other little cultural differences have zero effect on your life but make you want to scream?",1

Treated differently?For those that have or know someone who has a noticeable physical difference/disability/condition, how much does it impact daily travel life?   pre-story.

He's made huge progress, can walk well, and no longer requires a wheelchair. He feels ready to travel again within the next year, although at a slower pace.  But it has me thinking, has anyone noticed treatment to be different for people with noticeable physical differences/conditions? Perhaps specifically in developing nations? He prefers the exposed metal, non realistic leg look. Should he try to hid it with pants as much as possible, or not worry about it? know the majority of people are just living their life, are mostly kind, or curious. We are not offended easily. Staring and questions are totally fine, and kids are hilarious. But it also makes me wonder if he will be seen as an easy target for theft and scams, and how it might be in countries where prosthetics are unfortunately not commonplace?  might be a hard one to find people who can share thoughts. Most similar people he has met locally through support groups don't really travel, or don't do more than resorts or North America. sure if we should stick with something ""safer"" for now or get back into exploring.",1

Usually when we travel we buy the cheapest flights and stay at AirBnB's and eat sandwiches, etc. In other words, we travel as cheap as we can. He's been talking about how nice it would be to be able to eat well and not worry about spending too much while on vacation, which got me thinking about an all-inclusive resort. those resorts worth it? If you've ever stayed at one, do you feel like it was a good vacation or would you have done it differently? you for your thoughts! I should add that I'm not stuck on Puerto Vallarta. I'm open to any recommended locations in Mexico.",1

This time i applied through Netherlands and they rejected my visa stating that ""Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay was not provided"". They also state that ""my intention to leave territory cannot be established"" . I was travelling solo and have  also travelled before to south east asia before.  I gave them leave letter from my employer, employment agreement , my bank statements , my mum's sponsorship letter and her bank statements. Showed them my reserved flights, my hostel reservations, cover letter etc.  I wanted to celebrate my birthday in Europe, travel and experience amazing places . What are my options now that i have got the rejection for second time ? Should i reapply , appeal or leave it altogether ? What can i do ? They stated that the decision was made in automated process and hence not signed . Is it possible that they just rejected me on my previous rejection ?",1

My wife is a doctor she was planning to attend a conference in Italy last month. She got a multi entry visa for that purpose. Due to some work problems she couldn't attend the conference. She didn't use her visa and it is still valid. traveling to Romania next month. I've got a visa for Romania only (not Schengen because Romania isn't in the Schengen zone). My wife wants to come with me. Romania issues a short stay visa on arrival at the airport to anyone who has multi entry schengen visa. She's planning to use hers. question is will this cause her any trouble in the future? We won't go to any other countries.  Only Romania for few days. If she applies for another Visa in the future, will this affect her?",1

1274,"Canary logisticsHi all, thinking of going to the Canaries in January or February for a couple of weeks.  The main reason I've picked it is because of ease of transport from the UK airport I live closest to, and the fact that it's still fairly sunny even in winter.  I need some sunlight for a bone condition I have.  I'd like to see a few different islands, and can fly into either Tenerife or Lanzarote.   love history, and would want to see some historical sites and museums while there.   I don't actually like lounging around on the beach/by the pool, but need to do at least some of this for my bones.  I also wouldn't mind doing some spa/hiking/waterpark/activity park stuff, if it was nearby.  However, I will probably be travelling alone, so hiking would probably need to be with a group.   the above in mind, which do you think would be the best islands to visit?  I don't drive, so will be taking public transport - do you know much about ferries between the islands?  I don't want to see all of the islands; two weeks isn't really enough for that.  But it would be great to see two or three.  Which route would be best from either Tenerife or Lanzarote?  Any recommendations for not-too-expensive places to stay? Corvinus",1

We have 2 months of stay via Airbnb and tickets into the country, and no one thinks that a) the US embassy travel warning not to come to Ecuador b) numerous reports of violence c) complete shutdown of public transportation (so going in and out of cities would be difficult) is enough to refund our trip. We even called our travel insurance company and they said the same thing.. wondering if anyone else had experiences like this and how they were able to navigate the different companies policies (Airbnb, Jetblue, Chase for travel insurance) to get a refund?

I guess my questions are thus: What is the appropriate amount of islands to go to in 9-12 days? Is it more efficient to stay on one island and take day trips (i.e. stay on Naxos or Paros and take day trips to Santorini, Antiparos, Folegandros etc..) or island hop?

We do not require a visa, and we plan a stay for approximately 3 weeks, which is well within the allowed 3 months. During our stay we would like to cross the border of Botswana to visit Chobe park, which is allowed by our car rental company.  However, it is not clear if this would result in problems when we want to re-enter Namibia again. Do we get an exit stamp when visiting Botswana that 'ends our visit' to Namibia, or can we freely cross borders, as long as we officially leave Namibia within 3 months of our initial arrival? Also, assuming our rental car is registered in Namibia, we only pay a border crossing fee when entering Botswana?",1

1408,"A bit of a guide on travelling to and enjoying EgyptSo, Egypt doesnt have the best reputation as a travel destination. A lot of people have issues with the constant harassment by vendors and con artists and the overall chaos of the country. I have just come from Egypt and really enjoyed my time there, and there are ways to travel to Egypt without having a miserable experience. Dont spend a lot of time in Cairo. Ill be honest, Cairo... sucks. Its absolutely massive, dirty, polluted, congested, ugly and incredibly noisy. Its unfortunate because Cairo does have a lot of history, but its a very difficult city to navigate. Its public transport is awful and taxis will constantly try to rip you off. The traffic is horrendous and it can take forever to get anywhere. If you spend all your time in Cairo, you probably wont enjoy Egypt at all. The air quality is also really bad. I would go, and maybe spend two days to see Coptic/Islamic Cairo and then the Pyramids and the Egyptian Museum. Then get out. Aswan and Luxor are much smaller, cleaner and have more to see and do. I would spend more time there. Abu Simbel, Karnak, Philae, Valley of the Kings etc... are all majestic. Taking a felucca down the Nile is also amazing. The Red Sea, White Desert and Alexandria are also worth seeing.  If you can, I would opt to take guided tours. I usually travel solo and dislike package tours, but it honestly reduces so much of the hassle getting around the country. Guided tours also help you avoid a lot of the scams and harassment from vendors. If you can, Id shell out a bit of extra money and take a tour. Egypt is a huge country and tours can also help you get the most out of Egypt in a limited time frame. Dealing with harassment: Like any other country, most of the tourist sites will have vendors trying to sell you stuff. Its the worst at the Pyramids. The magic word La Shukran, which means No thank you in Arabic, will help you out a lot. The best advice is just to not engage. Do not accept offers to ride camels, or get a guide or be invited somewhere for free. NOTHING in Egypt is free. You will always be expected to tip, or give Baksheesh. Ignore, say no thank you and move on. Honestly, the vendors here really arent any worse than in other developing countries, you just need to be firm and they will leave you alone. If they continue to bother you, look at them, say La Shukran firmly, and they will piss off.  Do not travel in the Summer. Egypt is hot. Like, punishingly hot. Going in summer is a recipe for misery. In Aswan and Luxor it can get up to 50 degrees in the summer. Also Ramadan basically shuts down the country, and everything will be delayed and slow. Best times to go are between October-March.  If you are a woman, try to dress more conservatively. Egypt has an issue with sexual harassment, and I would dress a bit more conservative at markets or in Cairo. This is not necessary at tourist sites. Avoid taxis, try to Uber or get transfers from the airport to your hotel/hostel. Much easier and way less hassle. Egypt is safe in terms of street crime. Muggings, violence and robberies are relatively rare and Egypt has one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. However I would be careful with belongings in markets or crowded areas. has a lot of nice stuff to see and do, and I found taking a guided tour alleviated a lot of the problems I saw about the country on this subreddit. If you do go, Id consider it, even if youre not a tour person like I am.",1

1411,"Heading to Spain in November, need some help with flying logisticsHello! I am a 22 year-old teacher, with some international experience, who is heading to Madrid from November 20th to Dec 2nd this year.  will be my first time flying alone and I'd like the process to be as painless and simple as possible. I'll be meeting someone once I arrive in Madrid, so I only really need advice on transport and potentially the first night. 

 I live extremely close to Dulles Airport (IAD) in Virginia, and therefore several other Washington/Baltimore airports as well. As for booking my flight, I just have a couple questions to streamline the process since my travel dates don't have flexibility and I'm used to just tagging along with other people when flying. Most of my options have me transferring flights at either JFK, BOS, PHL, DUB, or LHR to pick up my plane to Madrid. I've only flown out of JFK before and it was more trouble than it was worth. Most of the flights going to LHR only offer 1hr to change planes and I'm not sure if that is feasible, especially since I'd be new to the airport. Any help finding direct flights near D.C or easy layovers would be greatly appreciated. I'd be willing to drive an hour or two if it means getting a direct flight. 
2. Since my flight will be in the winter, I'd also like to set myself up to avoid potential flight delays/cancellations due to winter weather.  Any suggestions on airports or flight routes that would help prevent this? I'd hate to fly north to BOS , PHL, or JFK and be stuck for hours. D.C is already risky enough with weather. 
3. Once I do decide on a flight, what is the best option to purchase my ticket? I'd prefer to have a ticket that wont cause any issues with the airport/travel company rather than getting a cheap price.  budget is pretty flexible and I'd be willing to spend a little more on getting a direct flight/easy layover than saving a few bucks. For all intents and purposes, I am basically a new flyer that knows how to navigate a traditional airport. Also since I teach, my plan is to fly out in the evening of November 20th and return at any point on December 2nd. I realize that this is a lot of information, but any help would be great.  Need the most foolproof way to get from Northern Virginia to Madrid from Nov.20th to Dec.2nd.",1

1416,"San Franciso trip, where to stay, how to get around?Wife and I are taking her father to San Francisco for his birthday.  He's never been and last time we were there was  ago.  almost 20 years ago.  We got great deal on plain tickets to fly in to LA.  So we're going to rent a car there and drive up to SF.  Going to stay about 6 days.  My original plan was to find a hotel or Airbnb outside the city to avoid paying an arm and a leg for parking.  Also, it seems having a car inside the city is a liability.  By staying outside the city, I figured on the days we want to in to SF, we can take the BART or a ferry, and then just use public transportation to get around the city.  The BART/ferry back to where we are staying.  And I the days we want to drive up or down the coast, we still have a car to do that.  But the more I'm reading, the more I'm wondering if that's the best plan.  I've read some Tripadvisor forums that basically say to suck it up on the parking and stay downtown, that that would be easier.  Then I get concerned about reading about all the car break-ins and general safety of certain areas.  So, my questions are:  Should I stay in the city or would outside be OK? 
2. If outside is ok, where would you recommend?  I'm open to anywhere that has BART or ferry access.  From south of SF, or Alameda or Berkely.  Even so far as Vallejo (I was stationed at Mare Island in the 90's so it would be nice to see again), I know that ferry ride is quite long though.  But I'm open to anything that would work logistically to what I've already explained... and of course safe.  
3. If inside SF is recommended, what part would your recommend?  I know Union Square seems to be the popular recommendation, but anywhere else? budget is about $250 a night or about $1,5000-$2,000 for the whole time we're there for an Airbnb.  We plan on going to Alacatraz and some typical tourist things inside SF, and also drive around alot to Mare Island, Napa, and down the coast to Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz.  So a mix of things.

We want the focus of the trip to be Morocco so I'm thinking we should spend about 9-10 days there. My original plan was to combine Southern Spain and Morocco but I am wondering if I'd be trying to do too much ... today I found a $500 deal from SF to Paris and figured we could spend a few nights there either at the end or beginning of the trip and fly Ryan Air from Paris to Marrakesh for $150 round trip.  Paris in December? We would likely be there either the week before Christmas or a couple days after. Does Paris to Marrakesh sound like too long of a flight for a 14 day trip?

Which is the better option of these two: go to sleep at a normal time in London, wake up head to the airport and trust the sleep pills will work.

1522,"Someone convince me that G Adventures isn't a complete waste of money....(Experience with Tour Operators)*When I traveled through Southeast Asia in July 2016, I took the easy way out and booked a travel agency to handle all of my logistical needs. On the surface, it seemed sensible to pay extra money and not have to worry about scheduling flights and hotels while being able to cover multiple countries. Prior to the trip, I had been stalking the website of G Adventures, an Canadian based travel company which sponsors everything from 2-day excursions in Sydney to 50-day treks through the entirety of South America. In what was a combination of inexperience and being impressed by their website, I booked a 32-day journey through the Indo China region of Southeast Asia. When you include the roundtrip plane ticket and required travel insurance, the total cost of the trip came out to be about $3600. Below is my review of G Adventures and insight on how traveling through a travel agency is different from traditional backpacking.* a season backpacker, I decided to do a G Adventures ""YOLO"" trip through Southeast Asia that would allow me to see multiple sights without the worry of booking lodging and transportation......My thorough review is below. paid about $3500 (incl. flights) for a 32 day trip. After experiencing the trip, I could have planned the same trip for $2000 cheaper by using a Lonely Planet guidebook. In addition, you will pay AT LEAST $600 more to eat and do optional activities that are not included. (1/5 stars) For the amount of money I paid and the cost of hotels in SE Asia, I felt cheated based on the quality of the places that we stayed. Out of 15 hotels, I would say 3 were ""adequate"". It was so bad that during the trip we went to some third-world village down the Mekong River and slept in some children's bed while they slept outside LOL. It was even weirder because the grandmother was sleeping in the closet who spent half the night moaning. Many of the places were dirty and cost under $12 a night. (1/5 stars) guide was more worried about eating free food than actually guiding us. He was pretty shady as he kept pressuring people to eat his buddies restaurants every time we stopped in a city for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Given that we paid out of pocket, I thought it was pretty appalling and towards the end of the trip I myself broke away from the group to actually go sightseeing. I also thought the was unnecessary pressure to tip those who actually did guide and drive us around which makes me wonder if G Adventures was actually paying them. (2/5 stars) one good thing about this trip was that it covered ALOT of ground in that it went through Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. I felt satisfied in that I saw and did a lot of fun things (mostly due to my own initiative). (3/5 stars) conclusion, while G Adventures does an excellent job marketing, you can assume that you would save more than half the cost if you did the trip yourself. In addition, while I met SOME cool people, most of the people I traveled with were spoiled rich kids with a propensity for getting wasted (drunk). I can't understand for the life of me why you would pay so much money to go to a cool place like Hanoi Vietnam only to waste away in a bar. Whether it was the price, my fellow travelers, or the quality of service, G Adventures is not for me.",1

1567,"Need help PLEASE! Traveling Alone For the FIRST time.So, I'm travelling alone for the first time, I have only ever traveled with my family to neighboring states. So this is an extremely different experience for me. For the first time, I'm flying alone, and out of the country, destination; Germany. While my family has traveled before, it's always been very close and they're not very knowledgeable when it really comes down to traveling long distances, nor is anyone I know personally.  done as much research as I can, but I'm a SUPER nervous flyer, and always silently bawl whenever I fly. Not to mention, I panic and jump when I hit even the slightest of turbulence, due to some severe ""turbulence trauma"" when I flew over the rockies on my way home from Las Vegas one year (We were literally lifting up off of our seats while we fell for few second intervals (seatbelts are a blessing), needless to say as a already nervous flyer, it was traumatic and terrifying for me.. anyhow..). Now, with being a super nervous flyer, and someone who is brand new to flying alone without having family to make sure everything is fine for me, I need any advice I can get.  little more backstory. I'm on a budget, so I booked a cheap round trip ticket for a couple of months for roughly 780 USD. It has three connecting flights, jumping from Portland, to Seattle (I know Seattle airport is large so I'm pretty concerned about navigating this one), to Frankfurt, and then lastly Berlin. In total it's about a 16 hour trip with not more than a 1-3hr wait in between flights. It's also probably a good idea to note, I leave for my flight in less than 2 weeks.  a few questions I have in specific, but I REALLY appreciate more advice on top of this if there is any that can be given!  My flights are with Alaska Airlines, Condor (which I believe is operated by Alaska as well), and Lufthansa. I will be only bringing a carry on, as I can't afford much else going towards my trip, so I have the size of my carry on all ready to go for the first flight, but with different airlines the policies differ. Should I worry about my carry-on not fitting policies of the other airlines? 
2. Is there even the slightest chance that somehow I will have to pay extra fees for ANYTHING aside from my flight that's already been paid for, and my one free carry on bag? I don't want to run into trouble while I'm in a different state or Country and get stuck there. 
3. Is there anything else that I need or SHOULD do when moving to my next flight aside from security and finding my assigned gate? 
4. I have my passport book, and State ID, and as far as I can remember right now, that's all that's required to travel from the US to Germany, correct? (I ask this because I'm sure I have everything, but I'm blanking right now as I'm getting everything together for my trip)
5. I most likely won't be getting any sleep between flights as I'm concerned that  I will miss my flight if I doze off at the gate, and DEFINITELY NOT during flights. What would you guys do? Are you okay with sleeping between flights when traveling alone, or do you tough it out to assure that you don't miss your flight? 
6. I've been looking for the Germany charger adapters or whatever they're called so I can charge up my electronics (obviously), as I know they have different outlets. I've had no luck finding any on my own. Do they sell these in the airports? Could I maybe find them in Seattle airport, or maybe even Frankfurt/Berlin? Or lastly, is my best option ordering online? 
7. Additionally, treat me as a child with this post. I have hardly any knowledge, and this trip is kind of spur of the moment, urgent. So feel free to give me any and all advice possible about anything and everything having to do with traveling. Anything to do with Airports (or airports I listed if you have anything that may give me heads up to how to navigate them easily), flying, dealing with the fear of flying, Germany, tips, just really, anything helps.  for the lengthy post, but all help is really appreciated.

1582,"Trip Report-Colombia**Background:** I am a 30 year old single male traveler who has traveled throughout Central America. I live in DC but am between jobs so I thought I would travel throughout South America in order to save money and see the world. My first stop was Colombia. While I am not Colombian, I look Hispanic and can speak pretty good Spanish. Coming from a place (Washington DC) where everything was astronomically expensive, I didn't really have a budget because I'd save money regardless. However, I would say you need at least $150-200 USD a week to be comfortable as the peso is pretty week against the USD and EUR. (This includes accommodation) of Travel:** 6 1/2 weeks Bogota (1 week), Medellin (1 week), Cartagena (1 week), Santa Marta (4 days), Barranquilla (4 days), San Andres (1 week), Cali (1 week), Popayan (4 days), Pasto (3 days), Ipiales (1 night) I booked all my accommodations through [booking.com]( Because I was a ""Genius"" member I received several 15% discounts. The only place I didn't use booking.com was San Andres because hotels were insanely expensive and I used Airbnb. I spent between $60-150 USD PER WEEK on decent hotels with private rooms. Not bad considering my rent in DC was about $1500 a month lol. have specific reviews of my accommodation on my travel website;  PM me for the website link. in Colombia**\- I arrived in the El Dorado International Airport in *Bogota* at about 11:40 pm. After getting through immigration and customs, I stepped outside of the airport only to be greeted by a taxi line of 200 people which was increasing by the second. Much to my dismay, my Uber app was not working (most likely due to a prohibition on rideshare apps at the airport). I got into the taxi line and surprising waited only 20 minutes before I was off to my hotel in *Chapinero*. As much as I enjoyed my stay in Bogota, you need a PHD to figure out the citys transportation network. I experienced this firsthand coming from the airport. The way the taxis work is that there is a number on the meter which increases either every 100 meters or 25 seconds of waiting time. The number which it finishes on upon arriving at your destination corresponds to a chart that is supposed to be hanging on the back of the front passenger seat of the cab which tells you the total cost. However, not only didnt my cab have a chart but there were also extra charges included such as airport pickup and weekend rate. After arriving at the hotel and having no idea how much the ride cost, I gave the driver 50k Colombian Peso (COP) and he gave me 30k COP back which means my ride cost about $7 USD. Although I think I got ripped off, the COP is so weak against the USD that it really didnt matter and I was happy to be at my hotel. de Monserrate (Bogota)-** My Colombian friend that worked in the tourism industry suggested that I check out *Cerro de Monserrate* which was the highest point in *Bogota*. Although it was not the greatest day weather-wise, I decided to go do it on a Wednesday. Once again, I struggled to figure out the *Bogotas* transportation system and gave up and took a cab halfway to the destination. I arrived to see a building that looked like a train station out of an old western film with static lines going all the way to the peak of the mountain. It turns out that you can actually ride a cable car to the peak of the mountain. While technically you can hike it on foot as well (takes about an hour), it was too cold and I was too underdressed to do so. I ended up paying 12K COP (about $3.50 USD) for a ticket up. The ride up the cable car was interesting as I was crammed in with about 30 other people but was still able to get a magnificent view of *Bogota* before ascending into the clouds. The top of *Monserrate* was not what I expected. I thought it would be a scenic view area which one would spend 20 minutes and descend back down, instead it was an actual town with houses, restaurants, and even a church. Unfortunately, when I initially arrived, it was freezing and I couldnt see anything because of the fog. I literally took refuge in the catholic church, which happened to have a mass going at the time. I was rewarded with my decision to wait it out as the weather eventually did improve and I was able to see some great views of the valley from above. If I were in *Bogota* a little longer, I would definitely return on a more pleasant day and tour the whole town Piedra del Peol (Medellin)-** I decided to take a day-trip to *La Piedra del Peol* (The Rock of Peol) which is a hike situated between the towns of *Peol* and *Guatap*, about 85 kms east of *Medellin*. I arrived at the terminal del Norte station in *Medellin* and was able to buy a ticket to *Guatap* for 15k COP ($4.40 USD). The trip took about 2  hours mostly because the driver wanted to fill the bus up before leaving the city. *La Piedra del Peol* is actually about 15 minutes north of *Peol* and can been seen from the town. The bus driver dropped me of at a gas station at the bottom of the rock in which he referred to as parada la Piedra.  After overpaying for a water, I began my ascent up the steps situated next to the gas station. Turns out that this steep incline wasnt the actual trail, but rather a walking path to the entrance above. It took me about 10 minutes to reach the base of *La Piedra* where there were various shops, restaurants, and vendors selling high-priced ice cream and souvenirs. In order to begin the actual climb up *La Piedra*, I had to buy a ticket for 18K COP ($6 USD). Ascending the 700+ steps of *La Piedra* was a frustrating experience because it was 90 degrees, I was not in great shape, and it was difficult to get around others who decided to lay down in the middle of the narrow path. Despite my frustration, it took me about 25 minutes to get to the top of *La Piedra*. Before arriving to the very top, there is another area that has more bars and souvenir shops. While its designed for people to hang out and take in the view, I found it to be too noisy and crowded to really want to stay for an extended period of time. I finished the ascent by going through a claustrophobic tunnel but the summit provided a great 360 degree view of the surrounding valley. Thankfully the descent was a lot more comfortable as it was in the shade and utilized a separate staircase from those going up (Medellin)**\- What Americans refer to as Soccer is called Football throughout the rest of the world. Colombians are crazy about football as is the rest of South American. The city of *Medelln* has two professional teams. *Atletico Nacional* is the most popular and successful one whose colors are white and green. *Atletico* was owned by Pablo Escobar during the height of his drug campaign. They have won several national and international championships. In fact, they were the opponent of *Chapecoense*, the Brazilian team that perished in a plane crash in 2016 on the way to play in the Copa Sudamericana Finals (*Chapecoense* was eventually awarded the title). *Medellns* other team is known as *Deportivo Independiente Medelln* and their colors are red and blue. While *Independiente Medelln* has had some success, they are basically the LA Clippers of the city. I actually went to an *Independiente Medelln* match which cost me 20K COP ($6 USD) for a front row seat behind the visiting goal post. The game was exciting even though *Independiente Medelln* lost 2-1 to a lesser opponent. While I was there, *Atletico* played *Independiente Medelln* in what is known as *Clsico* *Paisa*. I wanted to see that game (and even walked to the stadium), however, the whole city was clamoring to get inside the stadium and there were no tickets left for purchase. I ended up watching *Atletico* destroy *Independiente Medelln* at a local bar. While the game started competitive, the final score was 5-2. City (Cartagena)**\- *Cartagena* is mostly known for its weather and access to the ocean. However, the city also has an enduring legacy of Spanish colonialism which is symbolized by the *Walled City* located in downtown (*el Centro*). The *Walled City*, which was deemed a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984, was originally built as Spains response to *Cartagenas* occupation and pillaging by British explorer Sir Francis Drake. Today, it serves as both *Cartagenas* administrative center and main tourist attraction. The *Walled City* is similar to *Antigua* in Guatemala in that it is filled 5-star resorts, upscale restaurants, and historical museums. There are also free walking tours that are conducted from *La Plaza de los Coches* in both the mornings and afternoons. I took the tour myself and found it to be very informative in which the guide explained random fact such as Mrs. Colombia is chosen every year from the center of the city and that *Cartagena* is divided into six socio economic classes (level 1-6) with the *Walled City* being a mix of level 4-5. The walking tour was a little under 2 hours with the suggested tip (the tour guide actually tells you this) being 20k COP ($6 USD). Regardless of if you do the tour, you can definitely spend a few days exploring the ins-and-outs of the *Walled City* which provides plenty of good photo opportunities. The only downside is that vendors will constantly follow you selling everything from half-empty water bottles to Venezuelan rappers promoting copies of their mixtape, although this is pretty common behavior throughout the *Cartagena*. Parque Tayrona (Santa Marta)**\- Having gone to *Minca* hike the day before, I woke up super sore the day I went to *Tayrona*. In fact, it would have been the perfect day not to leave the comfort of my hotel bed. However, time was not on my side during my visit to *Santa Marta* and I had already booked my ticket to the regions most popular tourist attraction, *Parque Tayrona*. Because I am a foreigner, I had to pay 54k COP ($15 USD) to access the park. While pretty cheap in US dollars, it is about four times the rate than that of a Colombian citizen 16k COP ($4 USD). Fortunately, I did not have to use my stash of cash as I bought my ticket online with my visa credit card. To get to the park, I went to the same place that I caught the shuttle to *Minca* and hopped on the public bus. It cost me 7k COP ($2 USD) and took under 2 hours to get dropped at the main entrance (*Taquilla Zaino*). I was able to show my pre-purchased voucher and copy of my passport but still had to pay 3k COP ($.80 USD) for daily insurance. Honestly, the insurance was pretty pointless as the trail was 10x safer than the one I hiked in *Minca*. Once I was in the park, I was able to take a shuttle bus for 3k COP ($.80 USD) to the actual entrance of the trail. I would highly recommend this as there really wasnt much to see within the 5kms that the shuttle bus covered. I found the trail to be extremely easy with only a few challenging parts. There were a few uphill climbs that were assisted by stairs and two points where I had to waddle through soft beach sand in the hot sun. The views and the environment were amazing and I couldnt stop taking photos. There was even a part in the middle of the hike where I could actually touch the howler monkeys that were hanging out in the trees. Throughout the trail, I saw camping grounds and local venders. However, food and drinks were extremely expensive throughout the park. This point was hammered home when a local woman tried to charge me 6k COP ($2 USD) for a dixie cup of papaya juice. After about 2 hours, I made it to the most populated part of the park, *Cabo San Juan*. It was a picturesque camping village that had a private beach. Even though it was touristy, I didnt feel overwhelmed by other people. I found my own spot in the shade and hung out for 3 hours transitioning between swimming and reading. As more people started to arrive, I decided it would be a good time to hike back. Unfortunately, there wasnt a shortcut back to the entrance and it took me another 2 hours to arrive back at the gate. Overall, this has been my favorite experience in Colombia thus far.**San Andres**\-The island had the best of both worlds. On one hand, there were plenty of duty free shops, restaurants, and casinos. In addition, many of the beach front properties were run by five star resorts which provided their own forms of entertainment. Despite being very touristy, the island maintained a laid back vibe which took me back to being on the North Shore in *Oahu, Hawaii*. The main beach was in walking distance from my Airbnb, and I basically hung out there for the week. The water was crystal blue and the beach was well maintained. Outside of sharp rocks being underwater in some places, the beach couldnt have been any better. Most days, I paid 7K Colombian Pesos (COP) or $2 USD for a beach chair and sat on the beach for hours on end reading and swimming. The only thing that stopped me from actually living on the beach that week was the weather. Unfortunately, it did rain for a good part of the week which kept me from exploring more outside of the city. Observations** *Plaza de Bolivar* in *Bogota* is in a pretty sketchy part of town. I would go for a quick photo-op but would not hang around as it is a mix of homeless people, government workers, and street peddlers
* Colombia is divided into various ethnic groups within the country. *Medellin* is considered the capital for the Paisa ethnic group who I learned are extremely proud of their heritage (to the point to where they identify more as Paisa than Colombian).
* Pablo Escobar is considered to be taboo within *Medellin* given the carnage that he inflicted throughout the city in the 80s and 90s. Many people wont even say his name while others will probably want to fight you if you mention him in a conversation
* There is a Colombian saying, *No dar papaya* or dont give papaya. While papaya is a sweet fruit in the traditional sense, the phrase refers to valuables such as ones wallet, cellphone, or money. The saying is a warning to tourists not to give others the opportunity to steal their stuff. While it applies to Colombia as a whole, *Cartagena* is a big tourist zone and pickpocketing is more likely to occur here than elsewhere in the country. Be aware at all times and dont flash your valuables while walking through the street
* There are several points above the northern wall within the *Walled City*, including an extremely overpriced restaurant, in which you can watch the sun set. My advice is to get there about half an hour early and sit on the wall as you can get a pretty decent view of both the *Caribbean Sea* and the *Cartagena* skyline.
* Prior to flying to *San Andres,* you have to buy a ""tourist card"" from the airline that costs about $33 USD
* Many of the tourists on *San Andres* island were there as part of a vacation package. Generally, hotels and food are extremely expensive on their own so many people opt for the packages which can cost hundreds of US dollars. While there are a lot of great looking hotels, I got the sense from talking to people that the packages were a rip off and one should opt for the DIY method when planning a trip to *San Andres*.
* There is another island about 58 miles from *San Andres* called *Providencia* which is more secluded and pristine. Unfortunately, it is also really expensive to get to. It costs $150 for a round-trip ferry ticket and about $250 for a round-trip plan ticket. Flights to *Providencia* only leave from the *San Andres* airport a few times a day and the ferry ride consists of over 3 hours in choppy waters. In addition, due to its isolation, the costs for basic necessities on *Providencia* are the highest in Colombia. Despite its issues, *Providencia* is worth checking out if one has the time and the money. Went Right:** Colombia is a great place to go because its reputation keeps it from being overrun with European and American tourists (unlike Costa Rica) and it is a unique cultural experience. I felt relatively safe but I also blended in pretty well. The people are relatively friendly but you need to know some Spanish in order to maintain a meaningful interaction with many of the locals. Colombia has everything from beaches to jungles to getaway islands. Went Wrong:** I wasn't terribly impressed with the food scene. While there was a lot of street vendors that sold fried foods, there were also more fast food places than local comedors that offered cheap a ""plato del dia"" with your basic chicken and rice. I spent a lot on transportation because the roads between cities weren't great meaning a 100 mile trip literally took like 6-9 hours. I took more flights getting around than I usually do when I travel. I thought *Cartagena* was a tad overrated. Verdict:** Overall, I enjoyed Colombia and  could have stayed  for 6 more weeks lol.

I am scuba certified and have only gone on a few dives, but would like to dive some more. I can only speak very basic Spanish addition to sites with good scuba, I prefer places that are quieter and have less tourists, but are still safe. From what I've gathered, Isla Espiritu Santo in Baja California Sur sounds appealing as apparently it is beautiful and doesn't have as many tourists and loud parties as other parts of Mexico not too interested in historical sites such as Mayan ruins or hiking. But it would be nice but not necessary to see wildlife, whether that be turtles, boobies, dolphins, whales, etc. I go to Hawaii or Mexico, I would like to spend at least a day in Honolulu or Mexico City just to check it out as there's a possibility I could live in either city in the future, but I don't need to spend the majority of my vacation time in the big cities suggestions for which should be better during the winter holidays?

1716,"I was once stranded on an island with no money.....What's your worse travel experience?*In September 2015, while living in South Korea, I went to visit a small remote island in the East Sea called Ulleungdo. While the trip itself was smooth and uneventful, my attempt to return to the mainland peninsula was a different story.*  
 was the week before Labor Day weekend in *Daegu*, South Korea and I was nearing the end of my tour of living in South Korea after nearly 8 months. During my time, I had been nearly everywhere on the Korean peninsula as well as the well-known Jeju Island off the southern tip. The upcoming weekend would be my last opportunity to explore somewhere new before I returned to the United States. After days of researching and asking around, I discovered *Ulleung Island* (or *Ulleungdo*) through a Korean translator that I worked with. He told me that while the island was relatively unknown amongst foreigners, it was considered a go-to destination for locals. Upon further research, I discovered that unlike other destinations in South Korea, the *Ulleungdo* tourism page was entirely in Korean. I immediately knew this was the type of place where I could get immersed in the local Korean culture without the westernized filters.  
 days later I was on my way to the coastal city of *Pohang*. *Ulleungdo* was small enough to where there was no commercial airport and the only way on and off the island was through a ferry. After staying the night in *Pohang*, I arrived at the *Pohang* ferry terminal bright and early ready to start my next adventure. *Pohang* was one of three terminals which had ferrys that went to *Ulleungdo*. It was extremely busy and crowded and I was one of the last people to get a ticket for the first ferry going out. The weather was sunny and there was no absolutely no wind (this will be important later on). The ferry was spacious, and the seats were comfortable. While the boat had limited entertainment options (no Wi-fi and only Korean speaking soap operas), my 3-hour journey was filled with excitement and anticipation.  
 boat arrived in *Ulleungdo* and there was an immediate scramble for the exit by the ferry passengers. After pushing my way through large families and ferry employees, I was greeted by the salty air of the *Dodong* port. I walked up towards the dock and made my way towards the center of town. After trying 5 hotels, I was able to settle into a local bed & breakfast and prepare for my *Ulleungdo* adventure.  
 have posted extensive videos of my three days in Ulleungdo can be seen on my travel site.....PM me if interested)*  
 3 fun and exciting days in *Ulleungdo*, I was more than ready to go back to *Daegu*. I had planned on taking the first shuttle back to *Pohang* on Sunday morning at 9 AM. I woke up and quickly packed my bag. As I was checking out of the hotel, the owner told me that the weather wasnt looking good for the day. Not really understanding what that meant I gathered my things and waved down a taxi. Even though the taxis on *Ulleungdo* were the most expensive in *South Korea*, I gave the taxi driver a majority of my cash and asked that he take me to the ferry terminal located in the next village over. The driver looked slightly confused but took me anyway. When I arrived, the terminal was completely empty. Although I was about a half-an-hour early, there wasnt even a ferry docked for loading. All the doors were locked, and confusion began to set in. After about 10 minutes of walking around, I decided to catch the local bus back to *Dodong*, the town I had initially stayed in. By the time I had arrived back to *Dodong*, it was raining pretty hard and the wind had picked up significantly. I found my way to the police station where the only person that was there was a 65-year old Korean man that spoke no English. After 10 minutes of attempting to communicate with him, I gave up and called the Korean Tourism Hotline where I could talk to someone that I could understand. Without mincing their words, the agent told me the ferry would not be coming today and that they were unsure when it would come because there were two typhoons off the coast of southern *Japan*. For those that are confused, you must understand that this was a time period where the South Korean government was particularly sensitive to ferry accidents. A year earlier, in 2014, the MV Sewol sank killing 304 people (most who were high school students). While the captain of the ferry was eventually found guilty of murder for abandoning the ship, there was significant backlash against the South Korean government due to their perceived failure to enforce comprehensive safety standards. It became evident that the overcautious of approach by the South Korean transportation ministry concerning my situation was connected to that event.  
 I left the police station, I faced another issue. I only had the equivalent to $25 USD in Korean Won (KW). While I had plenty of money in my bank account, actually being able to access it was the issue. Before leaving *Pohang*, I had withdrawn about 300,000 KW ($300 USD) to bring as emergency money. Even though *Ulleungdo* was an isolated island in the pacific, there were still 4 banks on it, so I figured there would be no issue in getting cash if necessary. However, as luck would have it, I arrived during the first week that all *Ulleungdo* banks required foreign debit cards to have a chip in order to access the ATM. Unfortunately, neither one of my debit cards had a chip and I would be unable to withdraw any cash during the trip. I also had to immediately pay 55,000 KW ($50 USD) to the hotel owners when I arrived to cover my stay. I then budgeted the remaining money to cover the three days on the island. However, with my stay being extended, I barely had enough money to cover another night in a hotel.  
 sitting in shock for 20 minutes, I finally went back to the hotel that I had stayed at, and gave my last bit of money to check back in. I told the owner of my situation, and they said they could help me out. We ended up going to a restaurant which they co-owned and they charged $200 USD to my debit card and gave me the equivalent in Korean Won. This provided me much needed relief and I was very grateful for their willingness to help me out. In addition, I was given free meals on at least 2 occasions by local restaurant owners who sympathized with my situation. For the next four days, I woke up and went directly to the ferry office. It was not until the fourth day when I would finally be informed that a ferry would be heading back to the mainland peninsula the following morning. Sure enough, the next morning the ferry was sitting on the dock and the terminal was buzzing. What started as a three-day weekend vacation turned into 8 days of being stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. However, none of that mattered as I finally boarded the ferry and headed back towards *Pohang* ready to take on my next adventure.

I am a Canadian (28f) looking to spend the month of January in Costa Rica. I found an apartment in the town I took a holiday in a few years ago, and I really want to take the plunge. I have a friend in CR that went to the apartment and checked it out - he says everything seems legitimate. This morning the landlord sent me a rental agreement. She wants a 50% deposit ($250usd) to save the space , and the other $250 is to be paid when I arrive. The agreement included the landlords personal info, the dates for the rental, the apartment address, and everything that is included in the price. This seems fine to me. I was going to transfer the deposit via tranferwise. 
While I am there I plan to keep my online ESL teaching job. The landlord says the internet at the apartment is great, and very rarely goes out. 
Everything seems good to me, but I am always worried I am being naive. What things should I be checking into before I send a deposit? TIA!!!",1

I am flying TAP airlines (US to Lisbon, Lisbon to Budapest) for an upcoming vacation. I unknowingly purchased a 'discount' fare through a third party website (lesson learned - not doing this again). It looks like to reserve a seat through TAP I have to pay minimum $45 for any seat, including middle seats, back of plane etc. I really have to pay this fee? Can I just show up to the airport without a reservation and get assigned a random seat at no additional cost? I did some extensive googling with no luck.",1

Did you travel the country and worked after? Worked at the beginning? Or was it more like on/off?
2. I want to meet as many new people as possible. Hostels are great places for this, but I'm more of a camper myself. Will campsites give me more or less the same opportunities to make new friends? Where did you find the most quality or interesting people?
3. Just out of interest. Where did you end up settling for a while, while working? apologize if these questions are maybe a bit vague. I will probably be going solo and I'm just really excited, but not sure what to expect. you either way!",1

We'll have about 14 nights so I'm wondering to split it 7/7 or consider a third city. I'm sure there's plenty we can find to do being in each city for seven days, but ideally I'd want to do one more city. what I've read there is no general consensus on the ""next"" city to explore so I am looking for suggestions here. We wouldn't mind a smaller/quieter city to balance it out with the larger cities. We are definitely foodies and enjoy some outdoor activities but nothing too crazy (no major hiking). I was originally thinking Hiroshima since I am into WWII history, but we aren't super into super old Japanese history though. I provided enough details here. Thank you!",1

1781,"A heartwarming joke from Georgia (not USA)In the middle of 60th there was a huge confrontation between Armenian and Georgian football teams. Fans were so overheated that some games were cancelled and militia and army forces were used to restore order. There were many games, with victories and defeats for both teams, but the story is about 1966 when Armenians won 1:0. Soon after that Georgian team ""Ararat"" won Armenians 5:0. All of goals were scored by one forward - Ilya Datunashvili. The victory was so overwhelming that republic went to unofficial holidays.  that days, a guide is leading a group of tourists through Tbilisi showing them an ancient part of the town. They are walking the bridge across Kura river when guide stops.  As you may know Georgian football team won an epic victory against Armenian team recently. It was 5:0 and all of it was scored by the single greatest player - Datunashvili. People of Georgia were so grateful to him that we built two statues in his honor. Look to your right (pointing at ""Mother Kartli"" statue). It's Danutashvili's mother. Now look to the left (pointing at Vakhtang I Gorgasali, King of Eastern Georgia in 439-522). It's Danutashvili's father. Now you see, his right hand is up and he is showing us his open palm with five fingers up? That's the number of goals scored by his son.",1

We plan to stay in Austin for a few days and then we would like to travel a bit and return to Europe after New Year. means of transportation are an option including buses, planes and rent-a-cars. We could also visit some of the countries like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico, but then we would have to fly to Europe from there because of the restrictive US visa my girlfriend has. you have any suggestions what we should definitely visit or do you have some itineraries for us?Thanks a lot! :)  
  
 itinerary is something like this:  
 5 days Austin
* 1 day San Antonio
* 2 days Dallas
* 3-4 days New Orleans 
* 1 day Kennedy Space Museum
* 1 day Miami
* 1 day Key West still have something like 4-5 days left. Should we check out something else in the US, or should we try to find some other country to visit like Cuba and then proceed back to Europe?",1

Also considering either the turtle release on playa Bacocho, or whale/turtle/dolphin viewing boat trip depending on how it's like this time of year.

I realize it's the off-season, but I really want to see some of Patagonia, even if the weather conditions/season isn't ideal. For this reason, I'd prefer to avoid camping outside and stay in modest hotels/hostels and do day hikes from there - either on my own using public transport if necessary, or on a tour group. Before you read on, let me say that I have no idea if these locations are even accessible during that time of year. If you know for sure they aren't, please let me know. I'd love to start as south as possible and work my way north - Ushuaia, followed by Torres del Paine, El Calafate, and El Chalten, before heading back to El Calafate to fly to Buenos Aires. Ideally, I'd love to spend at least 3 days at each Patagonian destination. already know how I'm getting to Ushuaia - Taking a flight from Santiago to Punta Arenas, then a bus to Ushuaia. However, I am completely stuck on what to do after that. I want to visit Torres del Paine, I have no idea where to stay. I've had a look at some of the hotels within the park, but can't find any that are open in May (and they cost an arm and a leg to boot). I've heard that a lot of hikers stay in Puerto Natales, but that's over 100km away - I can't see how it would be possible to do multiple day hikes departing from my accommodation there :-\\Due to the colder weather/icy conditions, I would be happy just to complete the easier hikes, such as The Fauna Trail, Laguna Azul, Laguna Cebolla, etc. Calafate and El Chalten seem easy enough - as I can just take day hikes/boat trips from those two towns, but Torres del Paine is really making me struggle. anyone have any ideas?",1

I will not have my student residence permit until December (there is several months delay to get an appointment). I believe my 90th day from the day I arrived in Germany is November 17. I have a trip planned to London from November 15 to November 17. I know that after 90 days, I cannot leave Germany until I receive my student residence permit. I spoke with the authorities here in Germany, and they think I should be allowed to travel from the UK to Germany on this 90th day, but they asked that I contact the british embassy to verify this with them. I contacted the British embassy, and they emailed that they cannot provide information on travel/visa topics. Further, they said to contact a different office, a visa office, but this office explicitly says on their website they will not reply to any emails on personal circumstances. They additionally charge 6 EUR or something to contact them. anyone know who I can talk to on this situation? I'm hoping to take this trip, but I can't risk not being able to re-enter Germany on this 90th day outside the US, I need to be able to return for my classes.",1

My main question is how to allocate those nine days between the two locations.  two ideas are as such:  A:  Day 1: Arrive in Kilimanjaro (JRO) in evening, travel to and lodge in Arusha
* Day 2: Safari - Arusha > Tarangire 
* Day 3: Safari - Tarangire > Serengeti
* Day 4: Safari - Serengeti
* Day 5: Safari - Serengeti > Ngorogoro
* Day 6: Safari - Ngorogoro > Arusha
* Day 7: Fly Kilimanjaro > Zanzibar in the mid-morning, spend a good part of the day exploring Stone Town
* Day 8: Day in Zanzibar
* Day 9: Day in Zanzibar
* Day 10: Morning in Zanzibar, ferry to Dar Es Salaam in afternoon and fly home late that evening.  B:  Day 1: Arrive in Kilimanjaro (JRO) in evening, travel to and lodge in Arusha
* Day 2: Safari - Arusha > Serengeti
* Day 3: Safari - Serengeti
* Day 4: Safari - Serengeti > Ngorogoro

* Day 6: Fly Kilimanjaro > Zanzibar in the mid-morning, spend a good part of the day exploring Stone Town
* Day 7: Day in Zanzibar
* Day 8: Day in Zanzibar
* Day 9: Day in Zanzibar
* Day 10: Morning in Zanzibar, ferry to Dar Es Salaam in afternoon and fly home late that evening.  input would be greatly appreciated!

Enjoying wine/cocktails/beer, eating Italian food (beef/pork free is preferable), chocolate, coffee, beaches, taking in amazing views, walking around, local shops, history, anything that is budget friendly.   interested in:** Tourist spots with tons of people, driving, religious history (old churches are fine for architecture) Nothing crazy fancy, just clean is all we need. Maybe 2-3 stars?  Would like to be close-ish to public transport and city centers. I love hostels but my mom is less open to the idea. She *is* willing to get a private room at a hostel in Florence.  
Leave the U.S. on Saturday May 9 and arrive in Milan, May 10 around noon (2.5 days).  Train to Lake Como (considering either Como or Lecco, or any other place on Lake Como)

Prepaid expenses are not covered. Expenses must be incurred by You. Payments for additional expenses will not exceed $150 per day per person for all persons insured under Your Policy as named on Your Letter of Confirmation."" reasons for Travel Delay are: 1. Carrier caused delay (including bad weather); 2. Lost or stolen passports, money, or travel documents; 3. Quarantine; 4. Hijacking; 5. Unannounced strikes; 6. Natural disaster; 7.

I've read the accessibility in Khao Lak isn't great so it's difficult to get around by foot and taxis are hard to find (?), but I can't imagine that matters much if we can just rent bikes?  like to use Krabi as a base for a few days trips/potentially island hopping but are trying to avoid overcrowded towns and beaches etc. Wishful thinking? is mid-to-high if that means anything/helps at all. and all tips appreciated.",1

We have a tour booked through Discover Qatar during our long layover. I am reading conflicting information about whether we need a pre-approved transit visa for our 4 hour tour. I called Qatar Airways and the representative said we would need a visa which could be signed up for online or directly at Hamad International Airport. Discover Qatar visa page says: ""Nationals from a total of 80 countries* can now take advantage of visa free entry into Qatar, thanks to our new visa waiver upon arrival. If you are applying from one of these countries, a pre-approved transit visa is no longer needed. For more information, click here."" we're from the US and among the 80 countries, I'm assuming we are ok?

Their train to Milan (a Trenord train) was cancelled, and they were moved to a later train, causing them to miss their connecting SNCF train from Milan to Paris. I've booked them on another train for tomorrow morning, but I'm wondering what their options are for a reimbursement (for the train ticket, the hotel they had to book for tonight, and the money they lost on their Airbnb in Paris). The tickets were booked through Trainline, and I've read their reimbursement section thoroughly but it doesn't mention Trenord. [This]( is the only information I could find, but I'm not sure what exactly it covers, and it's nearly impossible that my parents will be able to get printed documents of their tickets and mail them in before they leave tomorrow morning. They tried to go to the Trenord office at the Milan station, but it was closed. At this point I'm doubting they'll be able to get much of a refund, but it doesn't hurt to try. anyone been in a similar situation before? Any help is appreciated - thank you!",1

2148,"We've never been abroad before, let alone to America. Very very naive parents after simple help for a US trip please.First of all please show patience as we've never been able to afford a holiday before.  We're leaving England and coming to the States :D :D :D, kinda' holiday-of-a-lifetime stuff to be honest, but we're still on a challenging budget.   going to Disney Florida.  We're thinking about Feb 2020.  SO excited, but don't want the holiday ruined because of some kind of naivety from myself - so some dumb, simple questions .. be kind!

  OK here we go:  We're choosing Feb because of price.  What kind of queue times should we prepare for in Disney?  Some people here say 'The big rides, yea, 2 hours plus if you're lucky even in Feb' - you're looking at 2-3 rides per day total?  Really?    (of course the disney website won't comment on this for obvious reasons)  I've heard that you can't cross the roads unless you do it at special places or you'll risk arrest for Jaywalking.  Surely I can nip across a road if it's clear?  On US TV programs I've seen them do it but then I read Reddit about overbearing cops all the time?  IMPORTANT ONE:  I am bringing along a 9 and a 7 year old.  Their safety is paramount.  Is there any service or any possibility of a way in which me and my wife can get out just me and her for 1 single night together knowing the kids are safe (coming back at midnight?)?  Just 1 night me and her .. the other nights we'll just go to sleep with them at 8:30pm   (we can only afford 1 room so no choice and that is ok).  A cost thing - is hiring a car ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL?  People here say the US is 100% car and if you don't hire one you can kiss goodbye to doing anything basically?  I'm not scared of driving in the states, again, cost  :/  People are saying 'Don't walk around at night' and 'Don't wear Blue - crips.  Don't wear Red - bloods.  Don't take your smartphone out or you're asking to be mugged.  Be careful who you talk to with your Brit accent.  I mean, to put it politely, I can't believe ANYONE would wander round Orlando under such 'rules'.  Is it over-the-top rubbish, as I suspect?   Are waterparks suitable for 7 and 9 year olds?  (we've never been to one).   I just see youtube vidoes of 80 foot drops called 'tower of death'!!!??   I hear about US gun culture.  Will I see normal people walking around with guns?  If someone non-police approaches me 'wearing' a gun or rifle, do I just treat them as normal, or am I/my family under threat?  If I do get out with the wife we're yearning to meet some people and just talk.  If I start talking to people in the restaurant, or bar, or park - are they going to think 'OMG what a wierdo' - or is that acceptable?  We want to get involved in the local culture including meeting the people but don't want to be 'the strange family of Brits ruining our time out by not leaving us in peace' to anyone else ...? I've heard if you see a street performer you have to ignore him because if you watch him, not giving him $5 or $10 afterwards is 'rude'.  So if we see a musician or anyone is our instruction 'eyes forward kids, march past, no don't look at him or nod your head to the music, or you're entering an unwritten contract to give him money'?  How do I know which are 'safe' and which are 'bad' areas of Orlando?  Is there some map or anything really saying 'Visit here for a wonderful time, but don't go 10 miles East in your search for a restaurant or you're in the 'hood' '   ??  I mean .. we're going to be scared of exploring ANYWHERE except for hotel >> disney >> hotel  - if we don't know if we're about to drive into some bloody gangsta's paradise  :/ if these are embarrassing naive questions - I appreciate any time you have spare to help us out.",1

Realistically, I have only about 14 days before I fly to Perth where I will stay for maybe another week.  arrive in Bangkok on the 9th September and plan on staying for maybe 3 days. There is a record shop there that I want to visit and I will not leave Asia until I have! Probably more than once too. Then I had planned on a couple of days in the Philippines, a few in Hong Kong, a few in Beijing so I can see the Great Wall, across to Seoul to see some of Korea for a few days before arriving in Tokyo to get lost in food, hip hop and technology for as long as I can afford.  previous paragraph probably gives you an idea of what I might be best skipping or something I may be missing out on that I haven't thought of. I'm fascinated by cultures, modern technology and in particular how other countries use it, music, food, and cities.  someone here has done a very similar trip, maybe taken a different route and could offer some advice? I'm thinking of shortening the list of countries I will visit by maybe one, or even two so that I have more money to enjoy the others. I know, I sound very touristy; Great Wall, Bangkok, Tokyo but honestly those are the things I've wanted to see as long as I remember and right now time and money is limited. Should I maybe leave out one or two of Korea, Philippines and Hong Kong or would that be a bad idea? Thank you.",1

I'll have just come from a fairly intense family holiday in Sri Lanka so will be looking for a mixture of being alone in beautiful sights (more Kerala), relaxing/partying with strangers (Goa) and the whole ""being swept up in a big city"" thing (Mumbai).  just not sure if covering four major areas in 13 days will allow for enough time in each place. I also want to minimise the amount of time spent in transit - eg. I'm going to skip Munnar and focus solely on doing the Allepey houseboat thing, just to avoid driving massive distances.  you think 4 days in Kerala, 3 days in Bangalore, 4 days in Goa and 4 days in Mumbai is enough time, or would you suggest restructuring that? I'm still figuring it all out and just open to any amazing advice you can give!",1
2256,"Portugal: Albufeira or Estoril?Hello all,  will be going to Lisbon later this month and I will be staying in my friends house.  will be there for a week and I do want to take the weekend for some beach life. Two places I have been looking are Estoril and Albufeira.  has more of that thrilling nightlife that I associate with San Tropez, Ibiza, Magaluf, Barcelona, and other party beach towns. It also looks like it has cheaper hotels and also more attractive women. (I'm a 24 year old single straight male)  Estoril has that beautiful charm that I loved about Monte Carlo and Venice. But does it have any nightlife? Something like jazz in the evening? Piano bar?  I go to Albufeira, however, I want to see if I can really go loose. What exactly is the Ibiza of Portugal anyways? I also really want to go to a boat party.",1

It sucks that we can't just walk back to our accommodation when we feel like it, but that's that, we gotta deal with it. But if there is no way to get back to the mainland after midnight it would be a real problem.  for other questions, in your experience, is the wind really bad in January? I know its cold, but that's normal - cold wind on the other hand is much harder to deal with. Do you think we'd just be better off going to a different city?

Is 5 days enough or too much for these activities? Also would love suggestions for things to do around Ubud that are both necessary and off the beaten path  thinking would leave Ubud the 31st and head to an island to celebrate the new year and relax right on the beach after for another day or 2 . Looked up Nusa Pedina, Nusa Lembongan and Gili Islands. All looked nice but where would be best to celebrate NYE? Fun but not ultra touristy....also if Ubud is fun during NYE should I just stay there and leave on the 1st? the last 5 days of my trip Im kind of lost.

2421,"[AskTravel] Vietnamese Citizens of Reddit, How Can You Get A Canadian Visa For A Short Visit?TLDR: My Vietnamese friend is convinced that she cannot get a Canadian visa. Prove her wrong. Reddit, I have a very close friend that is Vietnamese. I am a United States citizen, and she is a Vietnamese citizen. We would like to find a place to meet up and holiday for a week to get to know each other face to face, and perhaps plan a future together.  us, Vancouver would be a good place in between, and neither of us would have to take the travel time burden on fully. When I suggested any country in the Americas (Equador was another option), my friend insisted that there's no way she can ever get a visa outside of Asia.  I come to you, dear Reddit. Is it possible for a Vietnamese citizen to get a short-term visa for Canada, for holiday purposes only? If so, how hard is it, what are your experiences, and what should our first steps be? Also, how long does it take to acquire the visa if it is possible in the first place? in advance, you smart travelers!",1

My next step will be to send an email to the embassy (if they have one in Australia) lastly, if it matters, nic is at 18mg/ml and the juice IS flavoured.",1

I will not be working- only throwing money into their economy. I have means of support, and the money part of it can be proven to be sufficient. But my time there will go over 90 days the tourist visa allows. Some people seem to say hopping over to a non-schengen country and coming back will 'restart' the clock, but that seems incorrect... I know visas can technically be extended, but my 'volunteer' reason seems like it won't cut it. Some places seem to say the Student Visa is what volunteers use for longer-term stays, as long as I have a sort of 'invitation' letter from the organization? I will be calling an embassy/bureau tomorrow to ask, but maybe you travelers have advice.... hypothetically, if I go and stay illegally, what are the odds that they'd fin out, and that they'd do anything but say ""Pay us a fine and leave now""? if I were to lose my passport... I understand hopping doesnt work, but it seems some countries have asterisks on the schengen travel visa with the us (france, for example, has 180 days free stay, and country hopping \*does\* work in Poland, Im almost positive)... But sounds like Greece is not one of these exceptions...",1

Shot in the dark, first time posting here. planning my first trip outside of the US (save a two week trip to Nova Scotia when I was quite young), and my friend/travel companion and I settled on Spain. In all likelihood, we'll have about a week in early December, maybe 8 days for the trip. focused on Southern Spain, and in particular, Granada. Other than that, our trip is up in the air! were originally planning a trip that incorporated both Spain and Portugal, and were focused on a Lisbon-Granada trip, but now I'm rethinking a trip that's that spread out.  it feasible for us to fly into Madrid, and immediately train to Cordoba and do a Cordoba--Granada--Seville trip? I'm not sure if that's too much time for those three cities, or too little, and I'm worried how much time we'll lose by using Madrid as our flight hub. Any tips for planning a week-long trip to Southern Spain? Specifically, for a Cordoba--Granada--Seville trip? Should I reconsider the Lisbon-Granada game plan? thoughts or tips on any of this would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance from a first time traveller !",1

Also curious on how meal time work.Leaving this Monday 1:30pm EST and arriving 4:30 local time (3:30am EST). I've never done a long flight before, so I have no idea how meals work or how to best deal with jetlag. Here's my plan, please let me know if it sounds ok: morning I leave, wake up much earlier than normal. Maybe 5:00am. Try to start acting like it's Japan time, so ~6:00am eat breakfast (7:00pm JST). Get to the airport early, eat a small lunch 12:00. Get on the plane and immediately take melatonin and try to sleep. I would aim for ~7 hours of sleep, so i'd wake up 8:30pm est (9:30am JST) then eat breakfast if possible. Then i'd stay awake the rest of the flight, and not go to bed until ~11 JST. i'm not sure about:  Never used melatonin before. Not sure if I should use that, or find some other sleep aid.  How do meals work on the plane? Are there only certain times for meals? Do they only have dinner options, or can I actually get breakfast?  Does this schedule actually sound alright? I think if I wake myself up at 5:00am that falling asleep at 1:30pm wouldn't be too hard, though I have no idea if I can sleep through for 7 hours. Not sure if I should also try to go to bed early Sunday night so I can wake up at 5:00 and still have gotten enough sleep, or if I intentionally want to not get enough sleep so I can fall asleep easier on the plane. advice would be appreciated! First time taking a flight that's longer than 2 hours, and i'm pretty nervous about screwing myself up for the rest of my trip!",1

 SO and I are planning a trip to Italy in May 2020. We have a rough outline of the cities were most interested in. Looking to go for 2 or 2  wks and see historical sites such as The Colosseum and the Pantheon. never traveled outside the US.  order of importance (latter 3 are maybes):
Rome,
Naples,
Amalfi Coast,
Florence,
Venice,
Vatican City
 main concern right now are the flights (from Tx to Italy). The prices seem to vary wildly. We dont want to go completely cheap but dont want to use up our entire budget on the flights either.(Overall budget $5k-$8k). Is $3k for 2 people roundtrip normal? Any specific airlines to seek out or avoid? For lodging, were looking to go airBnB, is that a fairly safe bet? you! Flying out of Dallas.",1

2643,"Two week trip from Paris to Leipzig (Germany). Would love advice on whether my planned stops are worth it and must dos in those places. (Paris, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, Amsterdam, Cologne)Hi I'm a uni student from NZ and I am planning on meeting up with my girlfriend around the 18th of December who is currently studying in Leipzig. She will be busy studying until then and I am spending November in the UK and Ireland with family and need to plan my way to get to her from there, starting around the 4th of December. mainly looking for personal suggestions in these areas of nice or interesting spots that might not come up as a top result on other websites, and critiques on how I've budgeted my time. don't have a specific budget, but the idea is to stay in cheap hostels and either cook or go to cheap but quality cafes etc. I will probably be spending money on things like museums and historical sights and would love recommendations on these sorts of things, but not so much on night life or big things like going up the Eiffel Tower. I love history and architecture, and enjoy just wandering around and exploring. I really like seeing natural features, and am pretty fit so big walks aren't a problem. I'll be using public transport too, so won't be driving, but would be keen to cycle to cover more ground if necessary. other thing is that daylight hours might be quite short during this time so I need to be reminded if I am being too ambitious. my current plan is to get a train from London, where I will be staying before this trip, to Paris. I will spend four nights (3 days) there, with my main goal being to visit Versailles and the Louvre, and then see the other sights. I have seen a lot of people saying Paris is expensive not worth staying at for long so am wondering if I should cut some time out here and focus on a few must sees. I would travel to Brussels for two nights, Bruges for two nights and Ghent for two nights. These seem to be popular places, though I get the sense from some posts that Brussels is not as enjoyable as the other two, especially as I enjoy wandering. I'm not that familiar with Belgian history and would love some info on some interesting sights. Personal recommendations that might not come up as the first google search result would be super cool. This part is open to change too. I think I'll spend two nights in Amsterdam as its really popular on reddit, just wander around, maybe hire a bike, and look at some museums. Again, I'm not too familiar with the history so advice would be appreciated. I'll probably be staying with a family friend for a couple of nights in Cologne. I haven't finalized this but this part seems pretty straightforward, and then I'll get a train to Leipzig. I meet up with my girlfriend we're thinking of travelling around Germany, possibly Denmark, or possibly flying to Spain to visit her friend for new years, but we can't sort that out until she gets a sense of her timetable for the semester, but that's just an indication of things I won't need to visit on the way there. this is really open to change, and I could even spend a bit longer or a bit less time you so much for taking the time to read this and hopefully offer some advice :)",1

Unfortunately, both of us have never traveled by ourselves and I have never left the European Union so far, which means that this is sort of our first time to travel without parental supervision. looking up travel recommendations regarding Thailand and its sights, a couple of questions have popped up: We don't want to stay in Bangkok for three weeks, so we need a vehicle, but we don't know what to choose. We already know that an international drivers license is needed and we can also look the prices for cars/bikes up ourselves, but we don't know which vehicles are best suited for a trip that'd be (in total) several hundred kilometers long.
2. Maybe it's a dull question to ask, but do you have any ""insider knowledge"" (experience) regarding ~~Siam~~ Thailand that'd be worth sharing like underapprciated sights or errors/traps to avoid? This would be really useful, since we don't want to have a typical spoon-fed tourist experience, but we want to experience the countryside and culture ourselves and we have almost no experience. you could answer at least one of these question that would be really great. Helpful hints not regarding these two questions are also welcome.",1

First time posting in this sub so hoping for some positive feedback!  am looking at taking a business trip (I sell prints etc as a photographer) and I am 50/50 torn on where to travel to.  business partner and I do a trips very often but wanted to go off the beaten path (for us) some. We have always dreamed of going to Iceland but also want to go to Switzerland and Italy too.  of us are really well travelled with the exception of the US.  are certainly a factor. Were hoping to keep it under $5000 for a 10 day trip somewhere. We like to get off the beaten path but dont mind a unique city either. We will definitely be driving quite a bit and have came down to these two locations.  priced some stuff out and they both seem like we could have a good experience and get our jobs done for about $5000 (flights, food, rental car, fuel). I believe this is about what it would cost to get to all the places we want to go. Seems like rental cars and fuel would be our biggest driving cost.  the 2 looking for some feedback as to where you think this sort of budget would best be spent. Weve also considered some other places too but 80% of the places are outside of the US.  do landscape photography so having dramatic landscapes is key to our trip.  concerns with Iceland - I sort of dont like the cold,  IRS also has limitations for per diem expenses in this country that is approx $350 per day USD. I like the idea of the isolation and the landscapes are certainly no let down. I worry going in November 1-10th (our travel dates) would mean we have about 6 hours of light a day. I worry if its rainy (which it can be often) that we may just get skunked. We want to see the Northern lights etc. I would hate to be cooped up for 10 days in the rain/elements.  concerns with Europe - costs, I read that Switzerland is the most expensive place In the world to travel to. Fuel prices are very high amongst basically anywhere else. Im not sure how easy it is to get around, rent a car (usually a manual transmission but on the opposite side, I can drive stick but reverse sides NOT SURE). We want to cover a lot of ground so fuel costs Im sure will add up. We would likely venture to places where public transport doesnt go so I do feel a car for some period of time is necessary. We wanted to make our way to Italy too. Looking for tips on how to have a great time on a budget here too.  feedback or travel tips to these places is recommended. Id love to hear what you would do in my shoes.",1

Is Miami a good idea?We (both male, mid twenty, two friends) are from Germany and would like to travel somewhere in February/March 2020 where its not cold. We havent leaved Europe (really) yet but we are not that much in the mood for the east like Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, Australia. We would have liked to visit Japan, but at that times its too cold there and its fucking expensive. Because of the ""type"" of travelers.. we are not that kind of people who just wants to lay on the beach the whole day. And we also dont want to party (actually we dont really party at all), although Miami is the main city for that. We just want to hang around, see nice things, explore, chill.. I hope thats a help! I looked at the west and came to US. I will be in New York in the end summer 2020 so it wont be that. And although I would love to do a California roud trip, it would be out of our budget. (I guess?) So I thought about Miami. thought (without any researches) was spending something like 10-14. I guess 3-4 days would be enough for Miami, but I guess there are enough other things to do (and where to live) around (in Florida). So maybe we could change our place every 5 days or. We prefer to stay in Airbnbs, cause you are flexible and they are cheaper. Another little idea was, after spending 7-8 days in Florida, taking a flight to Kuba or the Bahamas and spending there another 5-6 days. The flights seem to be fairly cheap. But that are just simple thoughts without any ideas. are also open to another ideas for destinations. I just want to hear your thought/suggestions/opinions about that..",1

My SO and I will be visiting there for a week this December/January (over NYE). And, ironically, I'm much better at researching and planning trips to far-flung destinations across the globe than I am at planning ones to relatively close-by destinations right here in North America. SoCal-ers, hit me up with your best tips and advice for a week in the SAN. Some stuff about us: We're in our mid-late 30s, no kids.  Not on a super strict budget either -- not luxury travellers, but willing to spend on some boutique type hotels and unique experiences. We're foodies and (most of all) craft beer nerds. Already have a long list of breweries and brewpubs we plan to check out. We aren't really all that interested in the beach per se, maybe a stroll or two on the boardwalk, but we're not beach people, and anyway, it's winter so I assume it will be too cold to swim. Not that interested in theme parks either, but we'll probably want to visit the zoo, just 'cause. We're both walkers and transit users at home and abroad, though we are willing to rent a car for some or all of the time if we absolutely must. But hoping to avoid it as much as possible by staying in a more walkable neighbourhood (downtown? Gaslamp? Little Italy? Other recommendations?) and using transit and Uber where possible. We're interested in perhaps renting a car to get out of the city to go someplace interesting for a short day hike / see some nature. Anywhere interesting that's an easy drive from San Diego? Looking for cool ideas / suggestions for how to spend New Year's Eve. Any other quirky, weird, off-the-beaten track type of things to see and do? rarely have more than 2-3 days to spend in a city, so a full week seems like a luxury. Share your best advice!",1

2853,"It turns out there are two neighbourhoods known as Candelaria in Bogota, as I found out the almost-hard-way.One  is the historic and cultural hub where much of the accommodation is  based. The other is essentially Barter Town from *Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome*.   A few years ago my wife and I rode a colectivo (essentially a minibus)   with the destination marked on it. After an hour or so, we realised it wasnt the right place: brand names started to disappear from shops,  the  streets got narrower and darker...  a young guy got on, carrying a football. He took one  look at us and  realised that we were on the wrong bus. Conversing in  broken Spanish,  he explained that we had to get off with him. Looking  outside, that  seemed unwise, but it was unclear what else we might do.  We stepped out  into the night and he hurriedly took us to a nearby  police station.  They in turn hailed a cab, took the drivers  registration and phone  number and told him that if we didnt get back  safely, they would be  coming for him and his family. Ultimately we got  home, not quite  without incident, but safely at least.",1

2861,"First time traveling to Europe Paris/Rome/Venice/Florence/London - Suggestions/Tips/Tricks Please!As mentioned in the title my wife and I are finally taking our honeymoon and we will be going to europe at the very end of this month. We found a deal for flights trains and hotels that we could not pass up. Now our agency only handled the flights, trains and hotels, which means we get to make our own itinerary for the entire trip. We have a few MUSTs but would love suggestions, tips, tricks, advise and as much input as possible. Specially on what to do/see/eat and how to get around.  
Our Itinerary is 3 days in Paris, Asides the obvious Eiffel tower, Louvre and Versailles. We have about a full day open to go about the city so suggestions on what to do/eat/see are appreciated. 2 full days in rome, we think we can do the obvious colosseum and ruins in a day, maybe even squeeze in the vatican, but not 100% convinced if this is something we want to do yet, which leaves at least a full day worth of ideas to be had. We have 2 days in Florence, were planning a vespa tour of the city as well as a little tuscany, we want to go see the david and just enjoy the city so any suggestions on what to eat and what else we can do in the limited time would be great. 2 days in Venice, and were booking the obvious gondola tour but not really sure what else to do that's absolutely worth it for the time we have to spend there. Finally we have about a day and in London, were thinking about the normal tourist traps since time is so limited but we would love to hear any musts in such a short time.  have researched a few 1-3 days itineraries, but one of our main concerns is specifically airport/train terminal transfers to and from Hotels, and then just around the cities in general. We know we will have to walk A LOT. Paris I hear the best option is for a metro pass. But were pretty lost as to how to get around pretty much anywhere else. Are uber and taxis a good option? Some cities have hop on hop off busses, Are these worth it? Also when visiting other countries I usually withdraw money from an ATM, i feel like the little extra you pay is worth saving the time and hassle of an exchange house. Is that a good idea for getting Euros and Pounds? How much should we need to carry around vs having a credit card, I know some countries cash is still king. My wife and I tend to be a little more on the thrifty side of things, but we know if were going to do europe right penny pinching is not the funnest way to go about it.",1

2872,"My mum and dad are in Vietnam and my dad just sent these guidelines for Driving and Riding in Vietnam. Hope you like them!Driving and Riding in Vietnam and riding in Vietnam is easy, and by following a few simple guidelines you can ensure that your journeys will leave indelible impressions. Like most other countries, Vietnam's roads all have speed limits. These may be obtained under freedom of information laws from Roads Vietnam upon payment of an application fee. It is simpler however to match your speed to that of the majority of other road users. Having established a speed which is comfortable you should maintain it wherever possible. DO NOT BRAKE - the vehicles braking system should only be used to come to a complete halt at the end of your journey.  , unlike many advanced western countries has complete mobile phone coverage. This enables road users to constantly stay in touch whilst on the move. However some caution should be exercised in heavy urban traffic. On highways, as well as using your mobile to make or receive calls you can also make and receive text messages. However you should remember to occasionally glance up to ensure that you are maintaining your set speed and your vehicle is still located somewhere on the roadway. in Vietnam generally drive on the right hand side especially on highways. However in urban traffic it is preferable to choose that section of roadway which enables you to maintain speed thus ensuring steady traffic flow. Be prepared to weave continuously.  cities, traffic can be very heavy and the principal means of travel is by small motorbike or scooter thus enabling smooth and efficient traffic flow. Helmets are not needed. You should again maintain a constant speed. If your progress is likely to be impeded, you should slightly change direction - again - do not brake. You will be sharing the roadway with trucks, buses and cars and many pedestrians. As footpaths are reserved for commercial activity and scooter parking, pedestrians will be travelling parallel to, and also across your path. Pedestrians generally move at a steady pace and will avoid eye contact. You should judge any potential collision points, and without slowing, slightly alter direction to avoid collision.  intersections you will also find a similar stream of traffic crossing your path. This may require you to slightly vary your speed and or direction to ensure smooth flow. Many intersections are fitted with tri-coloured traffic lights - green indicates you may proceed; amber indicates you may proceed but a red light will follow shortly; and a red light indicates you may precede. As these lights were found to be of limited practical use, their main function now is to add to the colour and charm  of the streetscape. vehicle will be equipped with a horn. These were once thought to be used as some form of warning device but now are used to add to the excitement and aural soundscape. You should use your horn frequently but at random intervals.  and small bikes can be used to transport almost anything, from a family of five to commercial goods such as roller doors, or building products such as reinforcing bars or concrete. Be aware that riders transporting bulky products such as mattresses will have restricted vision and may move into your path without warning. If this occurs do not brake, but try to maintain slightly greater clearance if following behind. driving on highways, your speeds will of course be generally higher, but the rule is to again maintain a set speed wherever possible. Highways have lane markings. A broken line indicates that you may overtake. A continuous line indicates that you may overtake, but your vision may be restricted by a curve or crest. If during overtaking you find traffic approaching you - do not brake. You should maintain speed until the driver of the vehicle you are overtaking has finished text messaging and moves over - giving you sufficient room to pass the oncoming vehicle. Replacement wing mirrors are readily available for most vehicles throughout Vietnam. the general 'drive on the right' rule, you may chose to travel in any convenient lane on highways, or straddle the lane marking, thus enabling you to move quickly either way, adding to the variety and interest of your journey.  rural roads the road quality can vary significantly from poor to almost impassable, and you will share the road with slower objects such as water buffalo and earth moving equipment. Roads will often narrow significantly due to landslides and repair work. If you meet oncoming traffic in these situations - do not brake. You should sound your horn repeatedly as a friendly way of saying 'like you I am looking forward to the challenge of fitting two vehicles through a space wide enough for a scooter'. sudden changes to the road surface may move your vehicle in unexpected directions, you should increase clearances to other vehicles when passing or overtaking. 2 to 4 cm is generally sufficient.  travelling from Roads Vietnam.",1

2901,"How we ended up having dinner and drinks with our taxi driver whilst in Eastern EuropeSo we are in Slovakia, Koice to be precise, we have a day trip planned that is 49km outside of the city, so we request a taxi via an app, we get in the taxi and head to Hrad Slanec castle ruins. On our way we begin to talk to the taxi driver, he is pretty cool.  we get to the destination he informs us that the app doesn't work this far outside of the city & he offers to come and pick us up when we are ready. We end up getting lost in the woods before finding the castle ruins which was an amazing experience. in the day we contact him and he comes to pick us up and takes us home, the next day we make our way to another also miles away from the city, and spend a great day by the waterfall, travel options back to the city are scarce and we are out of the apps range. We find ourselves stuck, so we call our taxi friend from the previous day. says it is his day off and that he is at his father in laws but happily offers to come and pick us up, when he arrives he lets us know that he needs to pick up his dogs, we pick up bread for his father in law, then he takes us home and says call whenever. next day we have another plan outside of the city, (I'm sensing a theme here). We order a taxi and get a different driver as not to bother our friend too much. This takes us 5Km from our destination and says he cant go on as the road is too rough (meh). We get out and begin to walk thinking it will be quick, before checking google maps to find out it is a 2 hour walk (You guessed it the app is not available here) so we begin to walk, we walk for an hour before seeing a single car, we wave it down and ask if he is going to the lake, he says yes and offers to take us, we arrive at the lake thank him an go separate ways.  
We contact our taxi friend and he says he can pick us up at 19:00, we chill by the lake and wait for it to get dark to see the stars, our friend comes to pick us up and says he needs to drop the vehicle to another driver who needs it for the next shift, we get to the city and our friend jumps out and switches seats, and the new driver jumps in, our friend says he needs to drop him off where he lives so he can continue his shift as that is the procedure. so it is the 4 of us riding around the city and the new driver hasn't said one word, he drops us off by our taxi friends house. he offers us food.  
We go in for some food and he makes an amazing soup, after that he offers us some Czech beer, we chill for a bit before he says do you want to go for a drink I know a cool place, we head to a local place near his and drink beer and just talk for around two hours sharing stories, before leaving when we say our goodbyes and thank you and then get a taxi home ready for our flight in the morning.

While travelling though I had this complete shift in state of mind it was incredible, it gave me a different perspective of everything and I made a lot of self realisations about my life. I was this vibrant, extremely outgoing person where conversations were so natural and genuine. home though has been so depressing. I came back to exactly where I started. I went from this experience of new things all the time, constant stimuli, meeting so many people to just utter nothingness. My dad was watching tv and it made me realise how depressing it actually is, your watching the world through a screen without experiencing it..... I Live with my parents and was wanted to see them but after 15 minutes it was like I had an urge to take off again. They were exactly the same, same conversations, same everything. I have just had incredible boredom. Everything at home was the same it was incredibly surreal like I was in a dream state like. I just cant imagine life at home ever being good. I will never meet people like I was when travelling theres just no environment for that here. Or seeing new things and having experiences. I feel so lonely I went from having so many friends and so much socialising to coming home To nothing. Scary thing is I dont want to lose everything I learnt while travelling but its also like I can feel my brain slipping back into the mould I left my state of mind is completely different now and not in a good way. cant imagine I will ever feel like I did when travelling",1

After this, we will probably head off to Billund. my questions now: would be good to know? (like pro Tipps, legal advice, if you did a similar thing: what would you have liked to know beforehand) is it good to camp / legal to camp in the wild? *edit* I know there are laws in most countries regarding wildcamping. It would be really awesome if someone had a tip or two where it is definitely legal (at least to stay overnight, no fire)

3020,"Switzerland Itinerary - could use some assistanceI was hoping I could get some input with putting together a Switzerland itinerary.  I've done some research but am getting somewhat intimidated by the options.  I especially am having trouble narrowing down the best place to go for hiking in the Alps. have never been to Switzerland and would be traveling there in late July for one week.  Flying round trip to Zurich.  My plan was to see one ""urban"" city, but then spend the rest of the time out hiking in nature.  I am in my 30s.  I like art, hiking, street food, shopping, and generally exploring without a destination in cities.  I know Switzerland is expensive, so budget is relative here, but I'd like to keep things around $150 per night for accommodations.  I am entirely willing to increase the budget if needed, particularly if the increase in cost begets a much better experience in relation to the amount. have sketched out the following possible itinerary: **Day 1--Arrive in Zurich, immediately take train to Lucerne (sleep in Lucerne)**
* **Day 2--Lucerne (sleep in Lucerne)**
* **Day 3--Lucerne (sleep in Lucerne)**
* **Day 4--Train to Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen (sleep in Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen)**
* **Day 5--Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen (sleep in Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen)**
* **Day 6--Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen (sleep in Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen)**
* **Day 7--Train to Zurich (sleep in Zurich)**
* **Day 8--Head back home** questions: My main goal is hiking--is July a good time to go?  Best I can tell with my research, it seems like a fine time for hiking, but I know that the mountainous areas can get unpredictable and did not know if there was a better month to target for hiking.
2. Where's the best place to use as a home base to hiking?  Everything I have read suggests Berner Oberland/Lauterbrunnen, but I don't know what would be the best town therein.  Gimmelwald?  Murren?  Grindelwald?  Wengen?
3. Is Lucerne a good spot to get a feel for a Swiss city, or is Bern a better option?
4. Given this itinerary, is the Swiss rail pass something I should look into, or am I better off getting things a la carte because I will not be traveling between cities much?
5. What's the best regional ""splurge"" meal in Switzerland?  Is fondue worthwhile?  I will likely try to keep food costs in check by having breakfast/lunch from grocery stores.
6. Any other tips for traveling to Switzerland would be most appreciated.",1

3032,"Trying to organize a spa getaway trip, pref. In SEA. Any info/knowledge to impart?Im a noob to the sub, but Ill do my best to provide as much relevant information as I can. sister and I (both 20s females), are beginning to plan a spa getaway vacation; beach or jungle-type area were not sure, but definitely somewhere on the tranquil side. Were from the east coast (Philadelphia).  Weve been primarily looking at Southeast Asian countries and islands since they seem to fit our budget/location requirements pretty well, but Im admittedly feeling a bit out of my element. Some Quick Stats: Were aiming for mid-may, 4 to 5 day stay (not including travel time aka flying)
 Though were looking to splurge, were not quite ready to ball out. I am just graduating, after all. **Not including flights**, I have a soft budget of max $700 usd per day. Preferably much cheaper than that, but I dont quite have a grasp on the pricing yet to really know whats reasonable.  Were really interested in the whole relaxation vibe. Luxury is nice, but not a necessity. As you can guess, a spa is a requirement: places that have getaway packages including spa treatments would be a huge plus. not too concerned about excursions and such, but having some options would be a nice (but not required) plus. Good food as well!  I also want to add that we are two young females traveling solo; we are also black, which unfortunately can cause complications in some countries. My sister is a seasoned traveler (though shes more familiar with more adventurous itineraries) and I have done some light traveling as well, but this would be both of our first times in SEA.  think thats everything!

Perfect weather, no humidity at all, people say it is so crowded but I found it so chill.  Then I would spend the evenings taking it easy.  Was real nice in Waikiki because there was food trucks everywhere and not once did I have to go to a sit down dinner which is perfect as a solo traveller to save money.

3110,"Typhoid vaccine for IndiaHello! I'm going to India at the end of November. I was trying to get all my vaccinations taken care of, and when the topic of typhoid was brought up, my NP said she sent in a prescription for the oral vaccine, Vivotif, 2 years ago, and that I wouldn't need it again. However, I don't remember taking it at all. I remember taking the malaria meds, but not the Vivotif - it has to be refrigerated and I feel like I would remember that. I looked up what the pills looked like and I don't remember ever seeing them. I called the pharmacy and their records don't go back for more than a year, but I did submit a records request so I can hopefully find out whether they sent it to me or not. My NP doesn't want to give it to me again because it's not supposed to be repeated more than every 5 years. Thoughts? Does anyone know anything about taking Vivotif twice in two years?",1

My wife and I are looking for a stress relieving and relaxing time with our baby (he'll be under a year at that time). would prefer keeping it in North America, namely southern USA, Caribbean, and Mexico. Definitely want something warmer. like good food, museums, fake/easy hiking and trails, swimming, and anything else you can do with a stroller really. We don't drink or eat ""land"" meat (pescatarian).  been to France and Italy and had a blast just getting lost in their cities, but this is our first time travelling with a baby and we're kind of stumped on what to do.

None of us has been to Asia before and I wanted to pick your brains on the best way to navigate Vietnam. will be there for ten days. We are flying into Hanoi but what to supplement the trip with a couple other places around Vietnam. Im interested in the rice paddies and some of the scenery near the northern border - but Ive read that going south near Hoi An and Da Nang are also must sees when visiting. question is, how easy/efficient is it to navigate the country via train/bus? Would hiring an interpreter be helpful? Is it possible to merge Hanoi with both north and south in one trip? Or should we narrow down our choices to one or the other? Any advice or tips would be so appreciated! Thanks in advance!",1

My partner and I are 25 and it will be our first time travelling to SE Asia. We are spending two weeks in Vietnam, then flying into Chiang Mai where we will spend another week before heading to the Thai Islands.  have 4 days in the South and want to make the most of our time. We are by no means against having some day drinks or going to a bar in the evening, but have no desire to attend any (or anything remotely like) full moon parties, and so I think we are leaning more towards Krabi area.  seems like an incredibly large area so we aren't sure what might be the best area to stay in. I don't know if it is better to stay in one town and take day trips to different beaches or if we should try and find accommodation on different islands.  I correct in my understanding that Krabi town and Phuket are both good cities to access most beaches?(Railay, Koh Phi Phi) Is there another small town you would recommend instead?  on what we enjoy doing we are quite certain we want to spend 7 days in Chiang Mai, but aren't sure if 4 days is really enough time to really explore the islands?

We are also planning on working a long the route as we have not decided on one place to stay and work while over there.

If anyone also knows the best way to buy a camper van that would be helpful. Also if anyone has any details on what casual work is like over there as we are planning on moving around a lot.

This would be mid-late March 2020, 3 days in London and 2 days in Edinburgh or Dublin. Id like to find some (cheap) tips on what is worthwhile. First of all, which should we do - Edinburgh or Dublin? And what is the best way to get there - train, plane, boat? (the 3 kids) are 21-30 years old, so our parents would only pay for lodging and a couple meals. Are Airbnbs cheapest?
Also looking for a good balance of things to do. My brother needs a nature excursion, my dad needs architecture, I need markets and museums (not art though), my mom and sister like to shop (quaint local shops, or really high-end native brands like Burberry). My parents like things to be quieter and slower, which is why I was thinking of Edinburgh. My parents and brother would enjoy a brewery activity, but just one. I could spend all day in the British Museum - what could my family do nearby while I peruse the collections?
There are sooo many markets in London, which ones are worth our time? We enjoy spending very little time at tourist hot spots unless theyre really worth it (eg see Westminster and Buckingham but not do anything). Id personally really like to go to Dublin but how does it compare to Edinburgh, if theyre comparable? Just worried that Dublin and London will be too much city for my parents and siblings. you answer half a question or all the questions, thanks in advance!!",1

What would you do?I booked flight a month ago with XL Airlines from NYC to Paris and I realized last night I was unable to check into my flight online. When I was digging around, I discovered the airline went bankrupt and halted all sales/flights. I have no control over that, but they also failed to notify me-- and I sifted through my email/phone history to make certain I didn't miss anything.  No email, call, or even text, and I don't think its a normal thing to keep up with airline news so I heard nothing about it. I booked an alternative flight this morning, but I'm pissed. I called Newark Airport to let them know the flight passengers were not notified and could potentially show up but they didn't care. It still shows up on google flights that the flight is still occurring. I'm eligible for a credit reimbursement but I'm going to be $600 in the hole with this. Is there anything I could do to rectify this? What would you do if you were me? Thanks.",1

3361,"Just got back from an amazing honeymoon in Italy and Greece! Full recap and details.I posted this over in r/weddingplanning, but I figured you folks might appreciate it also. This was my second international trip and my husband's first. We got to do a lot in 11 days (12 days counting travel time), so I hope this recap is helpful to someone planning a similar trip! I wrote a whole lot below, so I tried to highlight the things I really liked in **bold.** \~$5,000** booked as much as possible in advance: flights, hotels, train tickets, tour tickets, etc. When all was said and done, we spent about $4,200 booking everything. Then all we had to pay on the actual honeymoon was minor daily expenses like food and a couple of taxi rides. All in all, I think we came in right around $5k. Wedding day! We live in Florida but wedding was in New York. Overnight flight from NY to Venice, Italy Arrive in Venice, stay 1 night Venice to Florence, stay 2 nights Florence to Rome, stay 2 nights Rome to Santorini, stay 2 nights Santorini to Mykonos, stay 2 nights Mykonos to Athens, stay 1 night Fly home, Athens to NY RECAP** Venice:** We took an overnight flight, so we arrived in Venice at about 11 a.m. We took a small boat from the airport to the actual city. We were able to check into our hotel and our room was ready early, which was nice, and we were staying right next to the **Rialto Bridge** which is a great area. We dropped our things off and went to walk around a bit and grab lunch. Venice is unlike any city I've ever seen. It's all narrow alleyways and water! Getting around can get kind of confusing, but it's also really fun. After lunch we went back to the hotel for a much-needed nap. That night we went for a **Gondola ride**, which is pricey but worth it for the experience. We then went to a wine bar for some amazing wine and light snacks, then grabbed pizza (also amazing) on the way back to the hotel. We passed out hard from exhaustion! Venice and Florence:** We got up fairly early to grab coffee and a croissant at a nearby bakery. Then we went to **Saint Mark's Basilica** and Doge's Palace. We went inside St. Mark's and it was absolutely stunning. We did not care to pay the entrance fee to Doge's, so we just looked from the outside. Then we went to the local Da Vinci Museum. It's very small, but was interesting. We had more pizza for lunch at a place called **Rossopomodoro** and it was great. Then we caught the 2pm train to Florence. The ride was about 2 hours. In Florence, we checked into our hotel (**Hotel Monna Lisa** \- highly recommend!) and relaxed a bit. That evening we went to the **Mercato Centrale** in Florence, a huge food hall with tons of amazing food and wine. We ate way too much, then checked out a couple of local bars. It was an amazing evening! Florence:** Morning coffee and pastry at a local bakery. Then we headed out for the day, first visiting the **Statue of David**, which was amazing to see in person. Then we walked to the **Piazzale Micelangelo**, which is about a 30 minute walk outside the city but so worth it. It's a huge plaza overlooking all of Florence, and the view is amazing! We then walked back into Florence and visited the Duomo. We hadn't bought tickets in advance, which it turns out is required to schedule a time to actually go in the dome. But we did get to climb the bell tower and had an amazing view from there. We got sandwiches for lunch from the nearby **Panini Toscani**. We were pretty exhausted from the walking and climbing, so we went back to the hotel and napped a bit. That evening, we had a glass of wine in the hotel garden, then headed out to our dinner reservations at **La Bottega Del Buon Caffe**. This was an absolute highlight of the trip! It's a Michelin-starred restaurant and it was absolutely incredible. We then went for drinks at nearby **Rasputin**, a gothic-themed ""secret bar"" which was really neat. Unfortunately, we were really tired and full of food and didn't have the energy to stay very long, but the one drink I had was good. **Florence and Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then headed out to grab lunch at a small pizza shop, **Gustarium,** which was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. Then we headed to the train station for our 1pm train to Rome. We had a hiccup here which was that we had planned to take the bus to the train station (we had taken the local bus to the restaurant the night before and it was so easy!) but at this time all of the busses were completely full. We couldn't get on a bus and were risking missing our train so we ended up walking the \~20 minutes to the station with our huge backpacks, which wasn't too fun. But we made it! It was about an hour and a half to Rome, where we took a cab to our Airbnb. We put down our stuff and then immediately headed out to grab an early ""dinner"" at **Sfiziarte** \- a casual sit-down eatery near the vatican. Food was so good! We then headed to Vatican City. Going here was a lifelong dream of mine and it did not disappoint. We saw St. Peter's Basilica, though we did not go inside. Then we headed to the **Vatican Museum** at 5pm for a **night tour** of the museum. They do these on Friday nights and it was SO worth it. Our tour guide was amazing and the museums are way less crowded at night. We saw and learned so much, with the tour ending in the **Sistine Chapel**! We then checked out a few bars in the area before heading back to the BnB. Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then went to lunch at **Alfredo Alla Scrofa,** which is the birthplace of fettuccine alfredo! It was great and also happened to be right by our Airbnb. Then we did a 3 hour guided tour of the colosseum and ancient Rome. The sights were amazing and we learned a lot, but 3 hours was a bit long in my opinion. We grabbed a snack at another great pizza place, **Pizza e Mozzarella**, then headed over to a different area of Rome where we planned to go to dinner at a popular restaurant called Tonnarello. Unfortunately there was a huge wait for dinner and we ended up going to another restaurant in the area, **Otello**, which also ended up being amazing! There were also a ton of small bars in this area with great specials, so we hung out there until we needed to go back and get some sleep. Rome and Santorini:** We headed to the airport first thing in the morning for our flights to Athens and then Santorini (there are no direct flights to the greek islands). We arrived in Santorini at around 4pm. We had been really excited to go here because we splurged on a honeymoon suite at our hotel (**Aeolos Studios**) and wow, it did not disappoint. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi overlooking the volcano. It was incredible! We had an amazing dinner at nearby restaurant **Aktaion,** then went to **MoMix**, a molecular mixology bar with fun and interesting drinks. We were tired from traveling so we didn't stay out too late. Santorini:** This was one of the busiest days of our trip because there was so much we wanted to do! We had lunch at a restaurant called Avocado, which was very highly reviewed but I thought was just okay (I just got a salad though so maybe that's why). Then we headed down to the Old Port of Santorini to go on a **volcano hot springs cruise**. Getting to the old port is no easy feat, as you have to climb down 587 stairs to reach it! There is also a cable car that can take you down, but the line was incredibly long so we chose the stairs. It was exhausting but a pretty cool experience. The cruise itself was amazing! We hiked the volcano (which still has an active crater, seeing the sulfer was so cool), and then got in the water at a nearby hot spring. We got back around 5:30 very tired and dirty, raced back to our hotel to change (we took the cable car back up thank goodness), and then left again for dinner. We had another incredible dinner with a view at **Argo.** After dinner we stopped at a romantic bar on the way back to our hotel, **Mylos**, for a nice drink with another great view. Santorini and Mykonos:** We woke up and the weather was awful! We'd had breakfast plans, but it was so foggy and rainy outside we didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so we just got room service. At noon we had to head to the port (different port from yesterday) to take our ferry over to Mykonos. We actually got very lucky because there was a ferry strike on this day and most ferries were cancelled, but for some reason ours wasn't! It was very stressful waiting to find out. We arrived in Mykonos and checked into our hotel, where we rested for a while. Then we went into the main area of Mykonos for dinner and drinks. We had heard a lot about the nightlife in Mykonos and wanted to experience it, and we certainly did! We went to a few places, but my favorites were **Alley Cafe** (which is actually just a bar) and **Skandinavian Bar**, which is a dance club. We both definitely had too much to drink and neither of us really remember getting back to the hotel, so maybe that wasn't too smart. But we had a blast dancing the night away! It was definitely the party night of the trip. Mykonos:** I woke up regretting my decisions the night before, as I was pretty hungover and couldn't get out of bed for several hours. We did manage to get up in the early afternoon and take a bus down to Paradise Beach, where we had lunch at a great restaurant, **Indian Palace**. We went to the beach but not for too long, then we took the bus back to Mykonos Town. I almost threw up on the bus due to being hungover so it wasn't great. We rested a bit more at the hotel, then went to **Karavaki Restaurant** for dinner. The restaurant is on top of a huge hill and has an amazing view, though it was a bit of a hike to get there! We went to bed super early due to our early flight the next morning. Mykonos and Athens:** We had a 6:40 a.m. flight out of Mykonos, so we were up by 4 a.m. It was tough but it ended up being worth it to have the whole day in Athens! We got into Athens by 7:30 a.m. and went to our hotel **(Palladian Home)**. They were able to have our room ready within the hour, which was great because we got to take a morning nap. Around noon we went out for a **3 hour guided tour of the Acropolis** and the related museum. I have always loved ancient Greece, so this was an incredible experience, although similar to the last tour I felt like 3 hours was a little too long and it dragged on at times. But we still loved it! I was singing Hercules songs all day, lol. That night, we decided to check out two bars that are on the World's 50 Best Bars List, **The Clumsies** and **Baba au Rum**. Both bars were incredible and it was a great end to our trip! Athens and New York:** We headed straight to the airport in the morning for a flight out at 9:25 a.m. The 10.5 hour flight home was pretty miserable (two hours longer than the flight on the way there), and I'm still adjusting from the jet lag, but it was so worth it! I LOVED** whole trip was easily the best trip of my life, and my husband agreed! I loved pretty much every second of it, but these are the things that really made it great: The itinerary - I was a bit nervous about hopping cities every 1-2 days, but it actually worked out great. We got to see a million things, but it was also never too stressful, as we found plenty of time to just relax and rest. I might make one change (noted below), but otherwise I think it was the perfect mix of relaxation and sightseeing.
* The prices, especially in Italy - we were so pleasantly surprised by how affordable everything was! You could find a big glass of wine for 3 euro pretty much anywhere in Italy, maybe 4 euro in Greece. Entrees which would cost $15-20 in America were generally under 10 euro. The islands were a bit more expensive, which makes sense. It was nice to enjoy all these restaurants and bars without feeling too guilty about our budget.
* The food! Not much to say here, just the food in both countries was absolutely incredible, so much fresher and more flavorful than what you find 90% of the time in America.
* Silly shirts - we got a bunch of those cheesy honeymoon couples shirts, regular Mr. and Mrs. ones as well as nerdy themed ones, and we had so much fun wearing them. I know it's not everyone's jam, but we figured this was the one time to ham it up. Plus, plenty of people noticed and offered us congratulations, and we got a free bottle of wine at 3 of our hotels!
* They honeymoon suite - we kept our accommodations pretty modest for most of the trip, but the honeymoon suite we splurged on in Santorini was so worth it. We relaxed in our balcony jacuzzi both nights overlooking an incredible view. Santorini itself was the most beautiful place I have ever seen and was just an overall highlight of the trip.
* Dinner at Bottega in Florence - I mentioned in the daily recap, but this was another splurge that was totally worth it. Neither of us had dined at a Michelin restaurant before and we were just completely blown away. It was the best meal of my life! I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY** are very few things I would change, but here are a couple of things that might have made the trip even better: Mykonos - If I could do it again, I'm not sure I would include the two nights in Mykonos in the itinerary. Instead, we could have stayed for an extra night in Santorini and then done two nights in Athens instead of one. It would have saved us money and time on the ferry ride to Mykonos, plus it would have given us more time in those two cities that I liked a little better. Mykonos was fun (definitely had the most straight-up fun night of the trip there), but it's not terribly different from Santorini and I'm not sure it was worth the trouble to go to two islands.
* Guided tours - We loved the night tour of the Vatican and I would definitely do that one again! As to the other two tours (colosseum and acropolis), I'm torn. We did learn a lot, but it was too much information at times and it got a little bit tedious. I would do maybe a 2 hour tour, but not a 3 hour again.
* Norwegian flight - we flew on the way there with Delta, but our flight home was through Norwegian. We got it VERY cheap and I guess you do get what you pay for. Apparently Norwegian is having huge financial issues right now, so they're leasing out their flights to another company, Hi-Fly. The plane was easily from the 1990s and had none of the features that our Delta flight had. There was a screen on the back of the seat but it only played a movie at the beginning of the flight and the audio didn't work. Then we got the audio working but it didn't play any more movies. On a 10.5 hour flight! There were no outlets or anything, and my millenial ass didn't bring a physical book to read, just a kindle which died. My headphones (wireless), also died. So there was nothing to do on this 10.5 hour flight except try to sleep, which didn't happen because it was a daytime flight and we were located next to the bathroom so I was hearing A TOILET FLUSHING EVERY 30 SECONDS. We both nearly went stir crazy by the last couple of hours. Sorry, that was a bit of a rant, and a very first world problem, but seriously - I would pay for a better flight next time. hope this was a little bit helpful for someone! I know I wrote quite a lot, but I hope I conveyed how seriously amazing every day of the trip was. We're so sad that it's over but we're already planning our next international trip! I would HIGHLY recommend this itinerary for anyone considering it for their honeymoon or just a getaway. It was truly magical.",1

Gives us 90 minutes to get out of Newark and over to JFK, through security and onto the flight to Rome. am pretty sure that's not possible, especially for the public transit bus that Norwegian has agreed to pay. it looks like I need a new flight Charlotte to JFK, which will cost around 250 dollars for the 2 of us. won't cancel the Charlotte to Newark flight, and they didn't do anything wrong / change the itinerary. won't give me anything that's not related to the JFK > Rome flight.   They will refund the flight, or move it to an overnight 48 hours later (11:30pm on the 30th.)

A full refund just means buying another ticket at higher price, and there aren't any EWR-FCO flights, anyways. you all, sorry this is so long, but I have no idea how to fix this.",1

They already told me that my normal service will not work over there with my model of iPhone.   are my main questions:  In China, what are you able to access while using a VPN with a United States IP address?  I currently use ExpressVPN for all my devices.  For China, is it better/more cost effective to rent a MiFi device?  Or purchase a burner phone/SIM card when I get there?

3390,"San Diego trip around New Year'sHi, I'll try to keep this pretty short. looking for a getaway from the East Coast for New Year's and are considering San Diego. I've heard the weather can be rainy around NYE. We don't want to go to the beach or tanning, but want something cool and comfortable ( wouldn't mind a little warmth, either). Is the risk of a washout high? We mostly just don't want to be anywhere cold, but would consider somewhere else if there's a very strong chance SD will be something like 50's and rainy most of the time. We're looking at getting in around the 30th of Dec. and leaving a few days later (~Jan. 3rd). Other than the Zoo, what activities and sights would you recommend to us? We're both young, and enjoy doing things around cities (restaurants, shopping, not too big into bars), enjoy nice views, hanging around nice areas, etc,. Physical activities are fine, too. As far as New Year's Eve, what generally goes on in SD? Anything cool that's not super wild (not a fan of getting wasted/open bars etc,)? Is there anything else unique going on around the holidays/that week in SD we should check out? Is this enough time (~3 full days) to see and do things without feeling rushed or like we missed anything major? Restaurant/food/coffee shop recommendations? We like pretty much everything (Korean, Ethiopian, Persian, Mexican, BBQ, Japanese, you name it), although I'll give you bonus points for anything we can't find easily in the DC area/ is unique to Southern California/San Diego (fish tacos?).

3421,"3 Days in FlorenceHello Everyone, wife and I are taking a trip to Italy for our 10 year anniversary in early November. We are making a 3 day stop in Florence and need some help. I have read through Rick Steves Italy book several times and have been combing through [Reddit's Destination of the week for Florence](  I was hoping to get some advice from y'all on our time in Florence! We will be coming from Vernazza with local train stops in La Spezia & Pisa to Florence after spending a few days in Cinque Terre. **Would it be smart to get off in Pisa and visit the leaning tower for a few hours before getting on another train and heading into Florence.** Follow-up to that is that I see there is a luggage locker storage in the train station. **Does anyone have the exact location of luggage locker storage and is this the safe/effective?** I would assume our train would stop in San Rossore station since it's coming from La Spezia.
2. As I mentioned earlier, we will have 3 full days in Florence. 1 day we want to devote to spending the day exploring Florence. We are planning on doing the the Academia, some random sight seeing and sunset at Piazzale Michelangelo. **(Any recommendations on where to get skip the line tour at the Academia?)** The other full day in Florence we were planning on the Ufizi and more just strolling around the city. We are wanting to plan 1 excursion day into Tuscany, but don't know where. We are really wanting to do some wine tasting or a winer tour. (We are big Pinor Noir people) It will be early November. So, I doubt you will be able to get those beautiful views at a winery since it will be winter time. Would it be best to maybe plan on just doing a city and tasting wine in town versus going through a tour company and doing a multi-winery tour? **What are your recommendations for getting out of Florence for the day and tasting some wine? Any specific tours?**
3. We will actually be in Florence on the day of our 10 year anniversary. I've seen TONS of  recommendations for various restaurants. **Anybody have restaurants they'd recommend for a 10 year anniversary dinner in Florence?** am SOOO excited for our trip! If anyone has any recommendations for things to do or places to eat in Cinque Terre for bonus points that would be great! We are staying in Vernazza, but plan to hit each town as we will be in Cinque Terre for 3 full days.",1

This option only works assuming I can get stopover with ANA flight. option is arriving in KL instead before going to Singapore. But the flight to KL alone is 21hrs which pretty much equals total travel time of going to Tokyo above.

3444,"Thank you r/travel for helping me plan this incredible trip. South Africa and NamibiaIve gone into lots of details in case anyone should stumble across this while planning an African vacation for themselves.  I pieced together all the information I needed from searching on this subreddit.  your interested in seeing pictures here is a link: [ travelled through Namibia with some time in Cape Town and Johannesburg. We considered camping but changed our mind when we saw that the price of renting campers turned out to be comparable to actually booking rooms in the lodges.  specifically referring to campers, not tents. 
This itinerary is an option for people who are not camping. (Or never have before  like us) majority of the trip was self drive- with the exception of a few tours we booked. We never felt unsafe and found the people in Namibia to be very kind. from the east coast of the US we found that going through ATL or JFK were the only options to avoid crazy travel times as long as 30+ hours.  planned everything myself, but if you are not interested in self-planning I learned that Cardboard Box Travel has great itineraries too. TOWN: We started in Cape Town and stayed there for only 1 very packed day which included HIKING up table mountain then taking the cable car down and doing the beautiful scenic drive around Chapmans peak. We squeezed in high tea at Mt Nelson (which is skippable). We are not big into city-exploration and minimized our stay in the city since we were anxious to get to the adventure. I have read from many previous posters that they love Cape Town and wish they'd stayed longer. For us 1 day was perfect and we were able to fit everything into the 1 day. Adjust as needed if you think you will need time for jet lag. (Be sure to check that cable car is open on your dates- it closes during off-season) RENTAL/DRIVING TIPS IN NAMIBIA- we arrived to Namibia via Walvis Bay which was an extra charge from the rental company but well worth it for us to save on time. Its IMPORTANT to rent a 4x4 and make sure you know your details about tire pressures! We had a flat tire at one point in the trip and learned the hard way about tire pressures. roads= reduce to 180 psi, Sandy dessert dunes in last 5km of Sossusvlei= reduce to 150psi, Plan to drive a LOT slower than you anticipate bc most of the roads are gravel and very bumpy. Add a couple hours to whatever google maps tells you. We downloaded maps for all relevant areas ahead of time on google maps app. This allows you to use your phone for navigation while still on airplane mode. Its still smart to seek advice from locals on which routes to take because it is more than likely that the shortest route which google will recommend is not always the best route- due to road conditions.  is no driving after sunset, it will void your rental insurance. Sure you can push it but you will probably regret it when something unexpected like a flat tire occurs. Almost everyone we met during the trip had a flat tire experience so go ahead and plan for that and pay for the extra tire at your rental agency. WALVIS BAY, NAMIBIA: I cannot recommend [Pelican Point Kayaking]( enough! It was so much fun and the amount of playful seals is unreal! They are all around your kayak jumping, playing, and rolling over onto their belly for cuddles. On the way to the inlet you drive past pink salt mines and fields full of flamingoes. The guides are very knowledgable and we learned a great deal from them about Namibia SWAKOPMUND is like a little oasis town in the desert. You drive through a lot of nothing until all of a sudden you reach a bustling little town with stores and restaurants. We highly recommend Jetty Restaurant or the Tug restaurant for dinnertime. Theres a lot to do here but we had a very quick stop and no time for any of it. Again. we were anxious to get to Etosha.  was one of few options we could find as a stopover to split the drive to Etosha. We didnt have the best experience here. Just somewhere to sleep.  I would recommend just getting up early and driving straight to Etosha from Swakopmund. We made a pit stop on the way to Grootberg at Twyfelfontein. The roads on the way here are awful- so bad that I would not recommend this for nervous drivers. We passed through the KUNENE REGION while here and the different sightings of tribes people was fascinating. GROOTBERG, PALMWAG NAMIBIA:   Wow. so beautiful. Get here as early as possible and dont be dum-dums and miss the sunset like we did. The view, the food, the accommodations, and the people here are incredible. They helped us buy a new tire to replace our spare and set up the entire transaction for us at a nearby town. Superb hospitality. One of our favorite parts of the trip.  NATIONAL PARK: The highlight of the trip and the reason we came! I recommend 3 days minimum here. We moved through the park and changed lodges as we traveled to avoid back-tracking. This worked great for us and we didnt mind moving every night. We came during dry season in August and animals were everywhere! Really a life-changing experience. Newbrowni and Okakuejo watering holes were our best animal sightings. Also, lots of black rhinos at Halali and we saw no animals at Namutoni.  great stop on the way to Sosussvlei. Highly recommend Urban Camp ""Glamping"" which was very affordable, clean, and far exceeded our expectations.  2 days was perfect. Upon arrival we explored Sesriem canyon right outside of Sossus Dune Lodge and in the morning we woke up very early to take the guided sunrise tour with a guide up Big Papa, Deadvlei (at the base of big papa), and Dune 45. We chose to do this with a guide because we were not comfortable driving in the dark and after our flat tire we didnt want to risk getting towed out of the dunes too! That same day we went back on our own to watch sunset from the top of Dune 45.  To watch sunrise from the dunes you must stay in the park. There are only 2 options camping or sossus dune lodge.  necessary stopover on the way to Madikwe. We slept here and then on our way out early the next morning.  LODGE, MADIKWE: 2 game drives per day. Again, loads of animal sightings and this time with a guide. We saw a leopard eating its impala up a tree, white rhino trailing the scent of an opposing male, daily lion sightings, cape buffalo, jackal, wild dogs, and a clan of spotted hyenas feasting on zebra. The animals have daily strolls to the watering hole outside the lodge as well. We woke up from a nap at one point to find 20+ elephants outside our balcony having a blast in the watering hole. Elephants came around lunch time everyday and Cape buffalo came late at night everyday. Aside from the animals and knowledgable guides, this lodge is the lap of luxury. Everything is meticulously planned and a chef comes out to get your thoughts on the evenings dinner menu. Food was excellent. It was a big splurge for our anniversary and we loved it. We avoided Kruger because we were avoiding crowds- although if you do this trip and dont want to be in the lap of luxury- Kruger is the best option. We've never been to Kruger but it seems like everywhere we went people would compare it to Kruger. So now we must obviously go back to experience Kruger.  planned this trip last minute, 5 weeks before departure date. The order of our itinerary was primarily based on what lodges had availability. Almost everything can be booked online for Namibia through [booking.com]( or NWR's website. I love planning trips and sharing what I've learned in the process.  Hope you enjoy!

Our plan is to fly to London from the US east coast, spend a couple days revisiting, and then stop off somewhere else before returning home.  is where my question gets specific - I want to fly BA out of London City Airport. Mainly because its so convenient, but also because I have Avios that Im desperate to burn. So that narrows our my target cities. Prague, Nice, and Dublin have made the list. one of these cities significantly better than the others in winter? Im leaning towards Nice since weve already been to South France in spring, so wed see a different side of the area. Im thinking that Dublin/Ireland and Prague/Czechia might be best saved for spring or summer when we can get out and enjoy the surrounding area more easily. Im open to any suggestions, though.",1

* One with a map showing the cheapest flights from Hanoi -> (Anywhere) across an entire month. 
* One with a map showing the cheapest flights from London-> (Anywhere) across an entire month.  then comparing the results to find a match. Kayak has very limited flight data when you look months ahead. anyone know of a website specifically designed for this kind of thing? all.",1

My sister, also a US citizen, is flying from the states to visit us for a couple weeks over Christmas/New Years holiday. Were looking into planning a trip through northern Italy and shortly into France while she is here.  specifically, were looking to fly into Venice December 28 and out of Nice January 3, so a 6 day trip. During that time were hoping to stop in Venice, Verona, Florence, Cinque Terre, Genoa, Monaco, and Nice. Were also looking to rent a car in Venice and drop it off in Genoa, and then rely on trains/ public transport to get to our next destinations. Is this plan even doable in the time we have available or should we shorten it, such as fly out of Genoa instead of Nice? Also, any advice on where to look for train info/ticket purchasing would be extremely helpful.  thanks! Im sorry, I forgot to say, weve visited Venice before so were not looking to be there for too long",1

Never been before, I speak Spanish quite well but that's South American Spanish (the Iberian accent can be a challenge for me). I'm travelling on my own, this wasn't the original plan but that's what's happening now. I'm not a confident solo traveller and I'm in two minds about just not going and just taking the hit on flights and airport parking (approx 180GBP). I went to Chile in April this year and at least I had family there (hence my ability to speak Spanish though I'm very rusty) but I had a very unfortunate experience and was mugged there and had my mobile taken. I dislike travelling on my own (I've done a fair bit: Bangkok, San Jose, Las Vegas, LA, San Diego but find it stressful and miserable) and this experience has further eroded my flakey self-confidence. My question is, what is Madrid like for a solo traveller? Is it relatively safe (I'm from UK) and is there a lot to occupy me for the 5 nights I'll be there? Is getting around the city easy?",1

I put together our itinerary last minute since it's about a month away from it.  I've had a couple of questions about it as well.  flight leaves Honolulu at 10:45PM and arrives at LAX at 5:56AM.  Then we will be off to Gatwick airport via Norwegian at 6:10PM from LAX.  Arrive in Gatwick at 12:25.   will be staying at Hampton by Hilton London Riverside One.**  Oyster Card  we finish checking in before 3, start touring around Thames.   Tower Bridge   Life Aquarium Center time:  Eye around Soho.   Street and take a picture at John Snow Memorial Two:** up before 7:00 Am to get ready and start touring around the Thames. London Tower and Tower Bridge if we don't see them in Day One)  Bridge Bridge Globe Square Palace Paul's Cathedral War Rooms Abbey & Palace of Westminster  Modern Garden Observatory  Borough Market three:**  ready before 8 and off to the museum.  British Museum.  (Considering that I usually take a whole day to see a museum, i was thinking I could try to finish it over two day span or switch over with later days)   check out Sky Garden Four:** will be in North London mostly to catch Spurs vs Sheffield game at 3pm.  (Haven't gotten our tickets yet since I am the only one with a membership, so we are looking for general sales time period to get the tickets.  If all else fails, then we will go to a pub and watch the game) British Library (hope I don't spend too much time there)   Cemetery Hotspurs Stadium.  - eat at Chick King's before the game.   Five:** cross Marketplace Zoo Pancras station  by a pub that plays Liverpool vs Man City game Piccadilly Circus other Harry Potter venues I missed? We will probably see Australia House along the way in Day Two.  ) 6.**   up at around 6am to get ready.   at Royal Albert by no later than 730 to Royal Albert.  > shadwell > Clapham Junction > Salisbury to see Stonehenge.  on the time, we could stop by Bath or Cardiff, but not super sure about the plan for this date.   7:**  to Windsor and see Windsor Castle.   the train to East Sussex and go to Seven Sisters.  8:** to Liverpool.  Pack light and ask if the hotel can hold our luggage since we will be coming back the next day.  Depart by no later than 8.  Royal Albert > West Ferry > Bank > Euston > Liverpool Lime street.  Check in at the hotel or off to Liverpool cathedral.   Liverpool Cathedral Park  Albert Dock  Museum  9:**  We were leaning toward visiting Manchester, but do you think a short trip to either Glasgow or Edinburgh is viable?  We will be returning to London straight, but the travel time is an issue.  Even if we were to go to Manchester, I'm not sure what we would see other than the Old Trafford.   10:**   Street and Holmes Museum Gallery Place Market 11:** Relax and pack our things for France.  Visit places in London that we may have missed from previous days.  Print out our Eurostar ticket 12:** check out of the hotel before 10am.  Albert > canning > Green park > Russell Square to get to Saint Pancras by 12pm.  Have lunch and look around more or do if we haven't in Day 5.  Eurostar to Paris at 2:22 PM.   PM.  Arrive at Hotel Le Chat Noir  Have a dinner by our hotel and buy some bread from a bakery.  Could go to Arc de Triomphe.   13:** champs-elysee,  Tower,  dame (if we can see whatever part is left of it)   de Elysee  de Chartres Cable Car 14:** Paris Disneyland  15:** Palace -i heard it's easily a half day trip for many, but for me I have a feeling that can be doubled, so....  wondering if there's other things that can be done at night around Versailles or when we get back.   16:** take a trip to Strasbourg  France French-German border Rohan other Notre Dame

 \-Eglise Saint Paul  17:**   18**: check out of the hotel by 9 and take the train to Charles De Gaul Airport back home at 2:00 PM.   was just wondering if our plan is too crazy, especially for Day two.  is Paris Disneyland worth?  I would much rather travel to a different city/province, like Lyon, Bordeaux, Normandy, or Marseilles, but my girlfriend really wants to go to Disneyland... There's gotta be some compromise, so I included it, but wanted to see if there's anything significant enough for me to stay for the entire day.   good recommendation for Haggis in London if we don't make to Scotland?  I'm an adventurist when it comes to food, so any unique food or restaurant would be appreciated.   will most likely wait for a plane back to Honolulu from LAX, but it's gonna be a layover of at least 12 hours.  I was wondering if LAX is safe, or take up or friend's offer for a place to stay despite our flight being at 7:30AM in the morning. you for your inputs! after many of your reviews, yeah this itinerary seems really hectic and crazy.  I probably wasnt in the right mind when i planned this. Thank you all for your thoughts.  I will focus more on London and Paris portion of the trip and try to have more relaxing one by spreading it out a bit.",1

My partner and I made a pitstop between destinations to a local beach in Canyet de Mar, Girona, Spain. It was so wonderful! We had so much fun. We were blissful unaware, ignorant, of the fact that our car was broken into and *everything* was stolen. know there are bad people in the world. I know there are thieves. It just makes me so damn sad that anyone would do this. The one thing that breaks my heart the most is that they stole all of my necessary medications and a medical equipment that I need to get better. I don't know if my insurance will cover me to receive that equipment again and I'm so scared they won't.

I begin, mentioned below are some facts: I already visited the UK last year and been to London and Scotland and have seen most of the sights both had to offer. 
2. I know how the public transport works in the UK and this time too my wife and I will be travelling using public transport.
3. Both my wife and I are quite fit and will be able to do hikes with moderate difficulties.
4. I am a landscape photographer and keen on photographing the countryside scenery.  Both my wife and I are not very keen on Museums, however we love historic buildings and architecture.
5. Our dates to travel this time is rigid. below are 2  draft itineraries which I have researched based on the cost of flight tickets. Could anybody kindly go through and spare some time to comment and advice.  1: 10 Nights, 11 Days Nov (early morning): Landing at Manchester Airport, take a train directly to the Lake District. we will have our base at Windermere for 3 Nights. Nov-04th Nov: Windermere and explore the lake district either by hiking or public transport or both.  Nov (early morning): Take a train to the Peak District. We will have our base at Castle-ton for 3 Nights. Nov-07th Nov: Castleton and explore the Peak District either by hiking or public transport or both. Nov (early morning): Take a train to Castle Combe (Cotswolds). We will have our base at Castle Combe for 2 Nights. Nov: Take a day trip to nearby Bath and Stonehenge. I know Stonehenge is a tourist trap but we want to have a tick beside that box. Nov (early morning): Take a train to London and roam around London and base for 2 Nights. Nov: London free roam. Nov (Early morning): Train to Manchester and explore few hrs before hopping on to our return flight (Late Evening). 2: 10 Nights, 11 Days Nov (early morning): Landing at London Airport, take a train directly to the Lake District. we will have our base at Windermere for 3 Nights. are identical except 11th Nov - Day trip to Oxford and return flight (Late evening) is from London. asks: What do you think of this itinerary? I am aware that between lake and peak district the journey time is almost 4 hrs and same goes for Peak district to cotswolds. 
2. Is Windermere a good base for to roam around the Lake district? Any great walks and hikes that I cannot miss at any cost? Any apps or website where I can find the bus timetable and route map (I am aware of rome2rio and google maps but hoping for some localised and accurate information).
3. Is Castleton a good base in the Peak district? Again any great walks and hikes you absolutely recommend? for such a long post, I am hoping to get some responses. :) Many thanks and have a great day ahead.",1

His Dad inexplicably purchased them plane tickets to Perth and 30 days in an AirBnB.

I know this sounds ridiculous, but it's real and we're all very concerned. plan to try to have an unassisted home birth and aren't interested in talking about what will happen when that doesn't work out.

I fly the naturally generated layovers, the baggage just meets me at my final destination.  Is booking a trip like this any different? point of this is to avoid flying through the same airports (those being Chicago and Atlanta) every time I fly, because those airports are where the booking system will default to layover wise.  Yes, I'm probably being too complicated.  But I need to know this ahead of time just in case I need to budget more time for a layover if I need to re-check baggage and go through security again. the question is too confusing, I can try and clarify in the comments.",1

We are not ones who go on a trip with a list of things to check off. We could do a hike one day and then spend hours in a beautiful coffee shop, reading books. like take local flights when we can (Mexico City -> Oaxaca, Oaxaca -> San Cristobal). We value quality sleep and are not interested in taking an overnight bus (were never able to get that on a bus). the itinerary we have now: Mexico City: 3 nights
* Oaxaca: 3 nights
* San Cristobal: 3 nights
* Palenque: 2 nights
* Campeche: 1 night
* Merida: 3 nights
* Vallodolid: 2 nights
* Tulum: 2 nights
* Isla Mujeres: 2 nights we're considering or are worried about: there are some exciting day trips to do from Mexico City. Volcano hiking, Teotihuacan, and seeing monarch butterflies in one of the sanctuaries. Puebla also looks interesting. Thus we would consider adding one more night in Mexico City.
2. cutting Vallodolid to make the trips less rushy seems like a good idea. What would you cut?
3. as an alternative not mentioned in the itinerary, we are also interested in San Jose Cabo to see the whales. Fly from Mexico City and go to Oaxaca after San Jose Cabo. feedback on the itinerary would be appreciated!",1

It's a longtime dream and I'm praying everyday things go smoothly. thing that bothers me though is that, aside from my parents, none of my friends or family are making any effort to see me ""one last time"" before I go. In fact when I reached out to someone about a week ago to meet with them, they made plans and then flaked, we had a mild argument, and it basically ended the friendship!

Huangshan, Xidi and Hongcun ancient villages), and then train back to Shanghai to fly back. Is this something doable in this short amount of time, or will we stretch ourselves too thin?",1

   we'd arrive in Seville, travel along the shown path and end our vacation in Seville.

And are there any areas/cities that are along the way that are a must-see? We'd love to do some hiking/exploring in some non-touristy areas.

We are very happy to rent a self-driving 4x4 and camp the entire time, but also interested in more organized tours. In terms of what we'd like to do - landscapes, cultural sites, desert dunes, beach, etc. We are not so interested in wildlife as of course time is limited and we've done a fair amount of safari as we live in Rwanda. would you recommend we do with this time?

Below is the list of websites I've currently checked on, but I'm still curious to know if theirs any others I might've missed.

We will also both be insured drivers in the campervan and are used to long road trips (but understand NZ roads are different to Aus). I have also been to NZ in a motorhome before but only visited the North Island. have drafted an itinerary based on online blogs and questions however would love any imput in regards to recommendations/things not to miss in each location. 1: arrive Christchurch 6am. Pickup campervan, drive to Lake Tekapo 2 & 3: drive to Aoraki/Mt Cook, do Mueller Hut Hike, stay one night overnight in Mueller Hut and Whitehorse Hill Campsite the next night 4: Drive to Wanaka early, complete Roy's Peak Hike (Or Isthmuth Peak depending), stay in Wanaka 5 & 6 : Drive to Milford Sound (full day allocated to drive), second day Milford Sound Cruise Tour, stay at Milford Sound Lodge one night and Te Anau second night 7 & 8: Queenstown (Adventure Activities, Gondola, Visit Wineries and Onsen Hot Pools) 9 & 10: Drive to Fox Glacier (full day allocated to drive), second day go heli-hiking (weather permitting), stay at Fox Glacier first night and Hokitika second night (to break up the drive) 11: Drive to Marahau (full day allocated to drive) stay at Marahau \*\*note I know people advise this drive takes longer than one day, if we leave before 6am and have two drivers is it possible to make it to Marahau by nightfall? Will make short stops at main attractions on the way but willing to drive in order to make it to Abel Tasman by nighttime. 12: Spend day in Abel Tasman (short walk and water taxi), drive and stay at Picton 13: Marlborough Sounds Cruise, drive to Kaikoura in the afternoon 14: Dolphin Encounter in AM before driving back to Christchurch with a 9pm flight back to Aus last three days will be very full on, but many people have said Abel Tasman, Marlborough Sounds and Kaikoura are unmissable. But very open to any suggestions. We would consider an extra day at Abel Tasman at the expense of going to Picton if this would be better (but I am desperate to do the Dolphin Swim in Kaikoura). have spent lots of time researching this site and appreciate the helpful advice given.

Anyway more importantly and the question I actually do need answering is, how long do I have to be out of the US for for the program to begin again if you get me? Like it says it can be used for multiple trips but has a max of 90 days right? So can I just leave the country for a day come back the following day and Id be good to go for another 90 days?

In a couple of days, Ill be heading to a bit to the west, and was wondering where I should head along the southern coast.  of the suggestions Ive had so far include Antalya, Mersin, Fethiye/Uzunyurt, Marmaris, Kas, and Seluk.  dont plan to visit all of these places, but after a few weeks of sometimes-strenuous travel Id quite like somewhere where I could chill by the sea and drink nice wine for a bit. Ideally, however, Id like to go to places that have a lot of history and that are culturally interesting; Im not really a fan of touristy, party beach resort areas. If I could do some nice hikes, too, that would be a bonus, but not a massive requirement.  be interested to hear if anyone has any opinions on the places Ive listed, or any other recommendations!

We are flying into Rome and out or Milan. We have two weeks holiday to plan for! We have in mind the following and would like to ask for some advice if we should plan for it or not or maybe something you can suggest that might be better!  key interest our the following:  Rome 
* Naples
* Venice
* Verona
* Dolomites
* Milan
* Florence being touristy, but filled with tons of history. I expect to spend a few days here to absorb as much as possible. Trevi Fountain, Colossemu, Sistine Chapel, Piazza Novona, St. Peter's Baslica, Roman Forum, etc.  I have to visit  ruins of Pompeii. Looking for some ideas here!  assuming being touristy again, I think we just want to experience the city and get wonder around. Taking a Gondola thru the canals and getting to see Saint Marks Basilica seems well worth the trip into Venice.  was suggested to me from a friend as her and his girlfriend take holiday here from Salzburg once a year. Famous from the balcony for Romeo and Juliet. From the pictures that he's showed me the city looks great!  Dolomites, the Italian alps.  Need I say more. From the pictures that I've seen posted here and on Instagram I feel the need that I need to see them. Taking suggestions for places to go to see and experience these bad boys.  I think is also filled with tons of history. Looking for suggestions as to what to prioritize here.  being at the end of our trip, I'm sure to that we will be exhausted but can't let that stop us. I have jotted down the Last Super, Cathedral, and making a trip out to Lake Como.  we have fourteen days over there, I think we will take trains city to city as much as possible with renting a car to get  the Dolomite and Lake Como. I'm posting here looking for help and suggestions to probably get the most out our time in Italy. I'm looking forward to all the information from you fellow travelers! Thanks so much in advance!",1

We just booked our flight and hotels and have a rough idea of what we really want to visit (Acropolis, archaeological museum, etc). Tho I have still a few questions. Would it be better to order a cab before arriving in the airport or is it okay to just get into one at the airport itself (I read somewhere they are parked near terminal 3?)  would mainly use public transportation to get about (metro), is this safe? Also, some other must see gems in Athens that we really should visit or some nice restaurants you would recommend? Thanks a lot for your advice/tips!",1

4148,"Taking our dad to SE Asia for his 60th. Were not sure which country to go to; Thailand, Vietnam or Laos?So were surprising my dad for his 60th with a trip to SE Asia. Therell be 5 of us going altogether, a family trip.  chose SE Asia because its cheap and its a place he hasnt seen yet (hes travelled almost everywhere else).  thinking about going in late January for around 10 days. Not a very long trip by any means but a necessary break from home.  folks arent exactly hotel people, they enjoy a balance of comforts and adventure, exploration, history and culture. They generally try to get off the beaten path a little bit every trip they take, and for some reason always end up in hilarious situations with the locals. So in short, they arent really fussy as long as its not just sitting on a beach the whole time.  also not particularly wealthy, so were looking for something mid-range and comfortable in terms of accommodation, with decent/interesting food (I guess Thailand is best for food?) wise were pretty open, hes not overly confident on a motorbike, nor is our mother, but myself and my siblings are. The folks would probably prefer to take buses, taxis or rent a car (Im not convinced about rental cars in SE Asia). 
 Id like to know if any of you have any advice or recommendations on a country best suited for this trip? Based on your own experience out there or if youve done something similar. 
Ive listed Thailand, Vietnam and Laos but open to others. I suggested Philippines too but after being there I think itll involve too much travel between islands/activities for only 10 days.",1

We don't mind this so much, we don't need visas and we  won't have much luggage and it's cheaper by hundreds of dollars (per person) this way. Anyway, I'm aware that I can buy tickets with the airlines directly but for the extra $10 or so per person, I feel that the [Kiwi.com]( guarantee might be worth it, so I want to ask about anyone who has tried to use. know a lot of people have complained about the ways in which Kiwi has screwed them over and these are welcome. However, I'm viewing it as a $10 insurance policy for something going wrong with this connection and I'm wondering if this guarantee has ever helped anyone in a situation where they missed a connection.",1

I went to measure it today though, with the wheels it measures just over 23 inches tall!  The 4 wheels are pretty small and on each corner, but they do stick out about 2 inches and can't be retracted. think I've covered all or most of my other bases as far as the flight goes, but now I'm worried I'll need to buy a new carry-on!  I'm hoping to get other people's experiences/advice.  Will those extra 2 inches in the wheels be a problem for me?

4239,"Central Europe or Spain for December Honeymoon TripHello! My fiance and I are planning our honeymoon for this upcoming December, around Christmas time and New Year's! $5k - 6k USD We plan to travel for at least 3 weeks (from Dec 17 to Jan 7, though dates are still a bit flexible +/-1 or 2 days since we are monitoring airfare pricing). are trying to decide between two regions to explore: Central Europe and Spain. searching through the subreddit and [wikivoyage.org]( we came up with very rough itineraries for cities we want to visit, as follows: Europe Amsterdam
* Berlin
* Cologne
* Prague
* Vienna Madrid
* Barcelona
* Valencia
* Granada
* Seville We chose Central Europe because we wanted to see some of the Christmas markets in Central Europe that are up during that time, and also want to see the architecture and check out all the food. We also thought of Spain for similar reasons (not too sure about Christmas markets), and also since I play classical guitar and a lot of classical guitar music comes from Spain. We expect to be very tired at the end of the day to enjoy any nightlife, but we'd be up to checking some of that out too. One of my concerns with picking Central Europe and cities that span between multiple countries is the travel time it would take to get to each city, and how much of that time would be taken from our 3 week trip. I would prefer to explore the cities without having to feel like I'm rushing through to check everything out. We looked up travel times between, for example, Berlin and Prague on Google Maps and it takes like 5 - 6 hours. concern includes any language barriers that there may be between so many countries. We are both English and Spanish speaking. That wouldn't be much of an issue in Spain, but more so in Central Europe. isn't much of a concern. only other country we have traveled to so far is Italy (Rome, Florence, Venice) and we absolutely loved it! we have: Are we being too ambitious in picking these cities in terms of travel time in between for 3 weeks? (for both regions)
* Would the language barrier be something to worry about? Is it easy to get around without knowing the native language? (Central Europe mostly)
* Any suggestions on cities we should include or exclude, or things we should do or check out?",1

I figured the airline would just refund me because they couldn't land the plane. The airline told me they would only give me credit so I then filed a claim with the travel insurance company. They said they would process it and wait. Then the airline called back and said they would refund my flight to my credit card. I figured the two parties worked it out and that was my refund. However, both refunds came through. One to my bank account and the other to my credit card. should I do? If I keep my mouth shut until they figure it out could I get in legal trouble or could they charge me interest on the money? apologize if this isn't the correct place to post this.

It sucks because for Work I often take Lufthansa and want to now shift to their Frequent Flyer systems. Of course they belong to the same alliance but every time I have my boarding cards with my Turkish Airlines number in it, the miles never add up. I have to manually write emails with the Boarding cards everytime. Turkish Airlines app does have a way to claim missing miles but every time I enter flight info it ends up giving back an error.
The customer service feedback states that not all miles from partner airlines are directly transferable and they need to be claimed via email.

I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions of places to visit based in London (specifically for someone who loves history and theatre):
I've been to London once before and thoroughly enjoyed it, I got to visit Camden Town, see Houses of Parliament/Big Ben and the area near Westminster, I also spent a little bit of time in the theatre district area (not for theatre but for food lol) and I visited the British Museum as well.
I'm a history major and an actor, so I really would like to visit the Globe (though I hear mixed things about visiting unless it's for a play). I'm also open to any suggestions of (inexpensive) theatre that may be happening at that time, bars/pubs, and museums with a focus on British history or any history (apart from the British Museum, which I spent most of my trip in last time lol). I had a friend recommend Freud's Bar on Shaftesbury Ave for cocktails and whatnot and I do enjoy Pubs and plan to go out at least once or twice while there. So any recommendations of places/nightlife that would be accommodating to someone visiting but also not just a tourist trap would be much appreciated! 
I'm much less interested in the typical touristy things in general and having family in Europe has made me appreciating traveling as really spending time in a place and getting to know it, and sightseeing for the sake of seeing things that I feel are meaningful or worthwhile, which aren't always the recognizable monuments, etc. 
I realize it's a big city and I'm not sure where I'm staying yet but any recommendations you may have would be great! Thanks!",1

I'll be arriving in Madrid (from Lima) at 13.40 and I want to be on the 17.25 IberiaExpress flight to Dublin - that's three hours 45 mins, should be enough, right?

What recourse do I have? I'm not sure that a  missed flight caused by a late flight (as opposed to a traffic accident or delayed public transport) is covered by typical travel insurance. And a short delay might stuff up my connection without incurring the first airline (PlusUltra) to have to compensate me.  I think my specific questions are: what's the average delay on flights from Lima to Madrid?

Arrival & departure flights still to do, so some wiggle room, especially at the end.  In general, what do you guys think of the itinerary?

* Am I right in thinking the weather in Vietnam in December will be decent but not hot, while in Cambodia & Thailand it'll likely be quite hot and dry?
* I've not included Sa Pa or Nihn Bihn, mostly based on A) time constraints and B) reading that Sa Pa in winter is just not as amazing as it is otherwise. Is this right? Or would it be worth it to try and force in 2 days of Sa Pa?
* I'll have quite some time in Bangkok still. I've read 2-3 days in Bangkok suffice. Are there any good trips to take from here?

4445,"Single Person possibly traveling with a coupleHey guys, I have been planning a trip to Spain for a few months now and all the people I have asked have said either no and that they would let me know (which to me feels like a no because they keep planning other stuff around that time). I had asked some people in a group chat that anybody was invited to come, they all said no so I was to the point that if I went I would go solo. Recently a couple from the group chat who originally told me they couldnt go are telling me they are going. My only problem with that is that I don't want to be a 3rd wheel in this trip. They told me it wouldn't be like that but knowing them I know there will be alot of times where they are going to be cuddling in different places (which i'm sure can be said about any couple on a trip) and I will basically be their personal camera person. I do believe they will try to make me feel involved but at the end of the day i'm just going to feel like the 3rd wheel and I don't think I will enjoy the trip like that. I told them in a nice way that I would prefer to not be a 3rd wheel in a trip, I could tell they didn't really like that response. They asked if I could get another person and I told them I would try but I have asked everyone I trust enough to go on this trip and have no idea where else I could find someone to join. No disrespect to the couple, but I would rather go alone than be a 3rd wheel. I feel kind of bad but at the same time I usually put what other people want ahead of what I want and I've been doing an effort to stop doing that but I sometimes have a hard time deciding whether I made the right choice or not. guess my question is, is it justifiable for me to basically tell them I would rather go alone than be a third-wheel (I am paraphrasing of course), or was I being unreasonable? This question is for anybody but anybody who has any experience of traveling solo with a couple, I would love to hear your experience and how you felt about it as well.",1

4478,"Ghent - A wonderful experienceJust wanted to share our experience during our stay here. are a on a 3 week trip across Europe. Our first stop was at Paris and we (me and my wife) were there for 3 days before we came here (Ghent) and with how people call it the city of love we didn't really feel that way with all the crowds and the line ups and the dirty streets and the not so clean train stations. And to be fair the city has a lot of tourists so it's kinda understandable i suppose.  right after Paris, when we got to Ghent, it was a complete change of scene. With no hustle or bustle, the calm serene atmosphere, the pretty streets, the beautiful canals, the architecturally brilliant churches, the wonderful people, and the list goes on. Everything is pretty here. I couldn't stop clicking pictures. I don't know if it's probably us cos of the vacation/ or of it was the Paris effect or something but in general feels like everything moves in a slow pace here.  seems super friendly: a couple of anecdotes i would like to share especially from my trip: me and my wife typical tourists as we are were clicking selfies on the St.Michaels bridge and a couple of school kids (i think) who went by us just stopped for a second and this one kid genuinely asked me if we were having a good time and i was kinda surprised at first but then was like wow that was really nice of him to ask. I don't know why he did that but made us feel more at home. Felt really good.  instance when we were walking around and looking around for the graffiti street (Google maps and our GPS really took us around the city for this) and we had a beer bottle in hand and were not sure how the recycling worked. We were carrying it with us for a long time not knowing how to dispose it. We didn't want to dump it in the garbage bin, nor did we notice any recycle bins on the streets we walked around. So finally we randomly asked this person who was just walking past us about this and he was like ""don't worry about this, im literally few metres away from my place i ll take your bottle, i care about the city and wouldn't mind doing this."" And he also thanked me for taking the effort. Kinda showed the spirit that runs in the city.  in all a really wonderful couple of days we had here. Would love to come back so much so that my wife has already suggested to leave everything and move here one day.  for having us Ghent/Gent, We had an amazing time :)",1

Ive been lucky enough to make it to eight countries already with school groups, in Central America and Nordic countries. My favorites by far were Costa Rica and Iceland. 
Ive always been nervous to travel alone because I am a woman and I know theres quite a few places that wouldnt be exactly safe to venture alone. However, I am desperate to get out of my state for at least a week each year and am looking into where I want to go next summer to begin saving. 
Im strongly considering the Netherlands and Belgium but I also want to research other spots. I want Japan to wait for a future trip with a loved one.
I know general safety precautions should always be taken but I am always a little on edge and itd be nice to be more at ease.
I love places with loads of history and are progressive. I love distinct cuisine and trying out things specific to an area. I cant rent a car yet so it needs to be somewhere relatively easy to get around (unless you have suggestions). Thats why I believe Amsterdam is a good bet but other ideas are appreciated because I can always consider them for future trips also.

4638,"European WintersHey all,  am an Australian (from Melbourne) who will be travelling to europe (13 countries - going with a tour group) between 19th december till 21st January. Melbourne winters usually have temperatures from 7-14 degrees celsius (average) during the winter. I know european winters, depending on the country as well are a lot colder so I  would really like some advice on jackets for european winters.  of my activities will be general sightseeing - we will be up in the Swiss alps for one day and the most we will probably do is some sledding. Apart from that we are staying around the cities. done some research and gone out and had a look at the various jackets currently available and Im a bit confused about brands and just how the weather will be and im not sure how much rain/snow to expect.  is what I know so far: dress in layers - with merino wool thermal for base layer - midlayer (i was thinking some warm/thick hoodies) and an outer layer which is going to be the Jacket 
2. Thick thermal socks/gloves/beanies - this Im okay with - ive got some warm stuff 
3. I know the jacket should be windproof and waterproof and be able to handle quite low temperatures - but theres so much variety im not sure which one would be best. I also feel the jackets sold in australia from australian retailers arent really designed for european winters as it does not get that cold in asutralia.  jackets Ive found are: Lands end is an american brand and america gets fairly cold as well so Im hoping that will do the trick, they have other jackets as well that are quite decently priced however shipping is quite expensive (50+ aud)  The second brand is mountain warehouse - I was set on buying one of the two jackets linked but I googled some reviews and they are shocking. There were more negative reviews than positive. However some people say its okay.  The third and final jacket I was looking at is the Uniqlo ULD jacket, I know europe has uniqlo too but Im not sure if the jackets are made the same - I looked at the european website and they had a lot more jackets that were more warmer than this one so i feel it wont really be sufficient. And it says it can withstand light rain.  know this is a lot but Im just quite unsure and I just dont wanna be cold since we really wont have that much time for shopping. My budget is max $200 AUD. Would like the jacket to last for melboune as well.  Need advice about good jackets for europe",1

My girlfriend & I are deciding to take the plunge and are prepping to go travelling for 3 months or so from late February 2020. We have a budget of around 4800 each (9600 total) and I am looking for some feedback about our itinerary. Any suggestions would be really appreciated. We are also wondering whether we would have enough to stretch the budget to perhaps 4 months as I've read that a lot of people have done the areas we're looking to go on the cheap!  
We are very keen on visiting the following countries, I've listed them in the order we are thinking of visiting them. Just for info, we will be flying to SEA from London Vietnam; Hanoi > Ho Chi Minh
* Cambodia
* Thailand; Bangkok > Phi Phi > Ko Samui > Ko Tao > Ko Lanta >Phuket
* Malaysia; Kuala Lumpur (short stay)
* Indonesia; Bali > Gilli Islands
* Philippines; Palawan > Cebu > El Nido > Anywhere else that sounds good.
* Back to London our first time doing something like this so I would really appreciate if you guys could let me know if you think we have too much on the itinerary (or not enough!) and if you think the route we have chosen is the most cost effective one or not. It would be also be great if you could suggest to us how long we'd need in each place. Really looking forward to hearing your guys thoughts.",1

One of us knows some people from Switzerland (Zurich) that we can live with which is part of the reason we're trying to go here (and the scenery too)

  
This may sound strange, but we also want to work part-time jobs while we're there to really immerse in the culture and interact with the locals. Something along the lines of a bartender, barista, baker etc.

  
We're all **Canadian** citizens and will have just graduated from university. I've done some research into the options to make this a reality but our options seem limited: The Youth Mobility Program allows for 12 months in the [Schengen]( area but you **have** to have a pre-arranged contract of employment relevant to your degree. We all come from engineering degrees are trying to work part-time positions similar to the ones listed above.
* You can legally travel in the Schengen area for 90 days without a visa, which we can make work but I couldn't find any information on whether or not we would be legally allowed to work there without a visa. anyone is aware of any other option for us to live in Switzerland this summer and legally work part-time jobs, I would be very appreciative!",1

Its not common in the country where she lives. wondering if the airlines would check it in just like a regular 62 inch bag or theyd charge me extra because its handle doesnt fold and its about 6 inches taller than a large trolley bag. Its thinner in width and the breadth and is well under 62 inch limit but its taller because of the handle.  checked with Southwest airline (I happened to be traveling with them today but my international flight is via Delta next month). The attendant said theyll do it. They check in golf clubs and baby strollers of similar dimensions, so that should be fine.

 though, right as Im about to go on another trip a week from Saturday, I go through the routine of calling my credit union, and letting them know Im headed out of the country again. Except all debit cards at my credit union are disabled for foreign use because of large amounts of fraud and theres no way to set up an exemption for me. Apparently this has been going on for a year (during which I did go out of the country, but made no mention of these exemptions), and they wont be able to iron it out until sometime next year. 
 I already have other credit cards, but Im guessing Im gonna need at least a bit of cash for odds and ends here and there, and Ive literally never had to worry about exchanging cash before. Our first stop is Edinburgh, so Im thinking thats gonna be the place to change usd, but how much should I plan on for a 10 day trip where we spend most of it on Skye and in speyside?

I've never been travelling solo (unless Auckland to Gold Coast for 3 days counts as one!). I'd love to spend time in Spain for about 10 days, and want to use a tour as a way to get accustomed to travelling.  looked at some of the itineraries of Contiki, Topdeck, G adventures and Intrepid travels, however haven't found any good enough for what i want (they spend only 1.5-2 days each in Barcelona and Madrid, and from what I've read on r/travel and related subs, that's not nearly enough to explore those towns properly), and they're hella expensive for what they offer (NZ $2000 for 10 days is a bit much) . I'm open to any country there really, Spain is just a preferred option.  26y guy, and not big into drinking or partying all night, so contiki is a no-no for me. Are there any non-major/smaller companies in Europe that do group tours that you guys would recommend?  If so, why would do you recommend them (personal experience, locations, pricing, etc)?",1

We are flying to Buenos Aires, spending two days, then heading down to Calafate and Chalten in Patagonia for 5 days. We then currently have planned and booked to fly back to BA to head to Santiago Chile, spend 2 days, then fly to San Pedro de Atacama for 4 days, then back to Santiago to fly back to the US. been to both BA, Patagonia, and Santiago, my wife has not. My dilemma comes with we have both become scuba diving fans, and we are also knocking on the door of having kids next year after that trip, so one last big international trip. I had suggested cutting out the Chile portion of our trip, and flying to Curacao to go scuba diving for 4 days. We would shorten our trip by two days, but that would mean we have more time off from work to do a short ski trip.  never been to Atacama, think it would be really cool, but I'm thinking after having spent a week in Patagonia, we might be all tired of looking at landscapes and ready to do something different like diving and sitting on the beach. know these are two completely different options, either desert or diving, but wondering if anyone else has any thoughts/comments. At this point I'd be happy with both trips, and there is basically no difference in cost. I'm Dutch, so that's one of the reasons for going to Curacao, other than it's also great diving.",1

A certain famous blogger's post on their dislike of the country didn't help either... 
That being said, we're still very drawn to the landscape, **food**, and living culture (not just historical landmarks). We tend to like cities. However, we don't want to participate in the type of tourism that encourages boom-and-bust tourism, or is damaging to existing local industries or economies (E.g. What the cruise lines do to Venice), or is voyeuristic and exploitative (""ethnic"" village visits seem like this, especially as a person of colour). I have a few questions:
1) Is 10 days enough time to spend in maybe 2-3 cities/towns? I was thinking of spending most of the time up north in Hanoi and the surrounding area. Any other recommendations for how to spend that amount of time in Vietnam?
2) What are some ways to avoid the type of tourism mentioned above? 
3) Is the scamming and theft really that bad? We've been to many other countries and cities not known for incredible safety (E.g. Mexico City, Bangkok, Mumbai, Barcelona, etc) but stories we hear make it sound like we'll lose our shirts within a day... in advance for your help!",1

More than that, tourist experience would be different from staying there for an year. Company is situated at Medellin & Bogota. How safe is Colombia? I don't know I've choice at this moment to pick a city if I accept the offer, but certainly I can press for one city over other if I know about both the cities. What are the things I should I know before traveling to either of the cities?. I read at many places Medellin is safer than Bogota. But Bogota being a capital, I personally feel, could be safer and things could be more accessible than Medellin. a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa!! I always wanted to travel to Latin America, but I'm honestly pretty worried at this moment thinking how safe could be these cities for someone who isn't imposing and is traveling alone!",1

5131,"Perspectives of an AirBnB host - Something everyone should consider before deciding to stay at an AirBnB\*Please note that this is just based on my experience in the recent months. I just needed to put ""pen to paper"" as a cathartic release. I love 99% of my guests and am a superhost who normally receive 4/5 star reviews. My advise on the bottom of the page, is just that, advise. You can take it or not. As a host we have no ""recourse"" if we get a bad reviews simply because someone didn't bother to read our listing in its entirety. While hosting is only a supplemental income for me (I live in a very high cost of living area), for some it is their lively hood. If they are great hosts and have put everything out there up-front before you book, they deserve the courtesy of an accurate review. have been renting a room in my home for almost 5 years now. When I first started to host on AirBnB it was a great way to meet new people, provide affordable accommodations and bring in a little extra money. Every little bit helps. I don't charge anywhere near a hotel, due to more competition in my area with other hosts, my rates are very competitive. Over the past year or so I have started to question whether the additional income is really worth the headaches. Keep in mind that my perspective is from someone renting a room in the same home with which I live. Its a different experience than those who rent entire properties. of the things that has started to surface in the past year or two, is how entitled some people feel when staying in another persons home. Mind you, this does not apply to everyone. There are some fantastic guests out there, they outnumber the bad ones. Yet its those bad eggs that sour your experience. This is the case for hosts as well as guests. It goes both ways. my experience, some guests seem to be of the mind that your house is a hotel and they can check in at any time of night. I have to be up early for work, so I ask that guests check in by 8 or at least check with me if a later arrival is ok. I am usually accommodating if asked. As a guest it would never occur to me to rent a room in someones home and then show up at 11pm at night with no communication beforehand. A hotel, yes, a private residence, no. Especially when your listing states your check-in hours end at a specific time? Please read the fine print, its not even fine print. Its right there for everyone to see. think because you have given them access to a room and bathroom in your home, that they are entitled to use everything. For example, the kitchen. If a host does not list the an area as an amenity, then no, you are not entitled to access that area. Do not make an assumption that it is just ok to do what you please. Most hosts, at least I hope most hosts, are accommodating if asked. I really have no issues with giving guests access to places not listed as an amenity, I just want to be asked. seem to have migrated into the age of entitlement, Where common courtesy and respect are a thing of the past (and yes, I know there have always been people like this out there). AirBnB is supposed to be a service that benefits both parties, but that only happens if both parties have mutual respect for one another. A host is trying to supplement their income and a guest is trying to save a little money. As hosts, we do everything we can to make sure our guests have a good experience in our home. We clean, we provide amenities, we open our homes up to complete strangers. Becoming a host is not a decision that is taken lightly, at least when it comes to letting someone into the home you live in. a guest please try to appreciate that you are receiving lower cost accommodations that in-turn give you more spending freedom during your travels. If you aren't receiving a much lower rate than a hotel, I don't know what to tell you. I personally search multiple sites for accommodations when traveling and pick the one that works best for me. You, as a guest, make the choice to stay at a particular location, that is your right. You make the choice to stay at someones home rather than a hotel. It is the hosts responsibility to ensure you have a safe, clean and pleasant place to stay. It is the guests responsibility not to take advantage of the hosts hospitality, and follow the guidelines that they have set forth. Guidelines, that you as a guest, should have read before booking. When you book to stay at a particular home, you are agreeing to the terms set out by the host. understand that sometimes crap happens that is outside of your control. In general, I am a pretty easy going person. It actually takes a lot to rile me up. However, when a guest gives a lower than stellar review, over things that are very clearly laid out in the listing, that is going to get me riled up. Yes, there are some hosts out there who may try to be deceptive in their descriptions, but most of us strive to provide the most accurate listing we can. It is important to us, that you can be confident in your expectations. Please, before leaving your host a review, make sure you have read and re-read the listing description, so that your review is fair and accurate. for those of you who are looking to utilize services like AirBnB during your travels, keep the following in mind Read the listing from top to bottom and everything in-between Follow the rules of the house, be courteous to your host(s). Dont show up to someones home at 11pm at night. If you plan to have a late arrival like that, check with the host before booking or stay at a 24hr hotel. Let your host know if something doesnt meet your expectations, give them a chance to make it right Most importantly, please be fair and accurate in your review. Read and re-read the listing so that you do not give a negative review for something that you would have already been aware of had you bothered to read the listing to start with.",1

5137,"Travel booking sites really know how to milk people so make sure you do your research.What surprised me was that a ticket to Kampala from MSP that transits through either Chicago or Washington DC showed nearly $2,000 for a round trip.  But if I just bought that ticket for Chicago to Kampala only, the round trip became $851.  And then I bought another ticket for $118 from MSP to Chicago round trip that would take me there so I can fly out of Chicago and then bring me back once that other flight from Kampala comes back to Chicago on my return trip.  So apparently I saved nearly $1K just by doing this workaround.  And then I noticed that the booking website told me I will need to apply for an E-Visa to get into Uganda, it showed it would be around $160ish, but then I went to Uganda government Visa site and it showed I can do it online for $50.   it amazes me how the travel industry is always milking customers in any given opportunity.  The booking companies take a good chunk of customers money and give less to the actual airline and Pilot, and this is I believe why we see low quality air craft like the aging old aircraft Brussels Air and everyone knows about Iberia airlines and how they are always delayed.  Some like Lufthansa airlines are great quality and I think that is because Germany is a rich country in general.",1

 just wanted to say that as someone who has always planned every aspect of my own traveling, this is the most stress free departure Ive ever prepared for. I was skeptical about a guided tour as first. However this week all I had to do was pack a suitcase. No itineraries to print out, train tickets to schedule, hotels to call.

I've read extensively and I know Australia is  HUGE. I also know there are some people out there who ALWAYS say ""three  weeks? You BARELY have time for ONE city!"" - I would love to travel for  months, but you know, vacation and funds are limited. In the past, we've  done typically 5 days in a city then hopped to another location for 5  more days (in Thailand, in South Africa, and in Europe) and this trip  would be 14ish days.  We don't have to see absolutely EVERYTHING in a  city or location - just like to get an overview. We also have enjoyed in  the past having more downtime at the end of the trip to relax and see  things leisurely rather than be busy right up until the end. coming from the States. 1 flying

Day 14 fly back to Sydney from Adelaide and start heading home  to decide if that's too much traveling around. I have too much  time  for just 2 locations IMO (Sydney and Kangaroo island) and maybe not  enough for 3 locations. not hikers  or backpackers - so 3-4 day hikes and camping don't interest us. We  basically like a well-rounded enjoyable trip - we're not generally  museum/winery/arts/food/shopping ppl - we like to sample all that stuff  but don't want to base any stops around it if that makes sense!  really am drawn to Kangaroo Island for some reason and the more remoteness/just exploring around. That's the only part of the trip where  we would want to drive if possible. I'm not so sure we want to do another city than Sydney. We like beaches but not for days and days. I did love how Whitehaven looked online!   
 get an idea of my past travels - I LOVED a trip that was Bangkok and Ko Mak Island - that was a dream trip for 10 days 4-5 days each spot. One big city, one cool little tropical island off the beaten track where we could safely ride a scooter for example.  so much for all your insight!I had originally written about a few places (Cairns)  and have been informed it will be cyclone season in late February and early March. And that I possibly had too much traveling around in my original plan. So here's a few questions:  
 Should I avoid the Whitsundays in Feb/March just to be sure?
2. Thoughts on Lady Elliott Island (heard there's a nice reef there) or is that still going to have the same issues as Hamilton Island?
3. Looking at my schedule below and my preferences/thoughts - anywhere else we could go? I feel we have too much time for 2 locations but not enough time for 3",1

So were looking for places in or around the Americas. that came to mind were Belize and Costa Rica. Well be flying out of Newark to get there.  thoughts? If you agree with Belize or Costa Rica then do you have any recommendations on where to stay, what type of fees come with traveling? (Some places have fees for meals provided through the day.) also, money is a factor. Looking for something somewhat affordable. We found Fiji to be super affordable in terms of plane tickets as well as lodging. Definitely wanna go back again late next year.",1

The second is from Hong Kong to Tokyo. I'm spending a week at both places starting in November. it looks like the protests aren't getting any better and it's just getting more and more violent. My flights haven't been cancelled, but for safety reasons I want to cancel both of these flights. booked my flights way earlier in the year and did not pay extra in case of cancellation. Based on both airlines' FAQs, it looks like they are non-refundable. In the case of the protests, is there any hope of cancelling my flights and getting my money back?",1

5246,"Traveling alone through Asia - I appreciate your help planning.Hello dear travel community. a 25 years old male from Europe who wants to see Asia - mostly alone. Since I've never been there I don't know how good my travel plan is or what I need to take care in different countries like tips and tricks or do's and don't's. Maybe some routes are not a good idea or maybe I'll stay too long or short at one place. Or just some tips to make my travel easier. I'll be grateful for every suggestion. I just want to travel to see the places and enjoy some food and stuff. Not beach-hotel 24/7 tourism.  is my ""plan"": next weekend I'll visit Istanbul(Turkey) for the third time for a couple of days (2-3). I just want to enjoy some food and watch a football match in a stadium next Sunday.  there on the following Monday I think about visiting Dubai. Now Dubai is not really Asia but I thought it's a cheap stop to asia. I'm not sure what to expect and how pricy it is (tho I know how pricy it can get). I planned to stay for 3 days. Just get around and see the place. Nothing spectacular. I read some articles about taxi drivers ripping off tourist and bad hotels. 
 that I thought about traveling to Mumbai(India). Since I follow some YouTube channels about India and read some nasty stuff I'm not 100% sure if Mumbai is a) safe b) enjoyable. I'm easy pray as a lonesome traveler. I'm interested in the Indian culture and food but as I said I'm not sure. It is most probably stressful. In terms of sightseeing and stuff I can't decide how many days are acceptable. So 3-4 days maybe.  there I might visit Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). The point here is that I don't know much about Malaysia nor Kuala Lumpur. I'm not sure about how long I should stay there or how the life there is for a tourist. Just had this in mind as a cheap stop from India . So any recommendations here are more than welcome. Kuala Lumpur I want to go to Hong Kong. Now Hong Kong is my must-have. Since I practice chinese martial arts for almost 10 years I know that Hong Kong is the hot(s)pot. Also my martial arts school is once a year in Hong Kong. This year I can see them there and spend time together travelling and training. So about 5-7 days HK are cool. Don't know about the accommodations there yet. And also hope that the protests won't affect me too much. stop and must-see is Japan. Directly from Hong Kong it's not that far to Tokyo Airport. I already had couple of friends staying and visiting Japan. The food is good but pricy. There is a lot to see. So I need the right amount of seeing some of Japan / Tokyo and not spending all my money there. If I'm lucky I can stay in a house of some students a friend of mine knows. It's 30km to Tokyo city but that way I could spare some money. Also 5-7 days are cool. Tokio the trip back begins. Since flights back to Europe are expensive I might stay a few days longer or fly to Izmir (Turkey). My relatives and some friends live there. And from there I go back to Europe. my plan so far. Budget is ~2000. At the end of October I get another 1k vacation money. Don't want to spend all that (haha) but it's better to calculate before traveling. tickets and accommodations are from the apps and Internet like google flights and Airbnb. feel like if I travel alone in a city that doesn't have too much to see I might get bored. That's why I thought about staying 2-5 days at some places. my family and friends suggested to cancel some stops and enjoy more time in a handful of places. I'm grateful about every suggestion about anything about the trip you give me :)",1

I loved every second. I had amazing friends, a great job...pretty much everything was going my way. I felt like I was thriving there, not just living like I do here in the US. that Ive returned home I feel extremely lonely. Its been nearly two months since Ive gotten home, but Im realizing I feel so alone. Japan I had a lot of English-speaking friends who I did a lot of things with often. We lived in close/close-ish proximity to each other, so we always were getting together. It also helped the entire island was basically no longer than a couple hours drive from top to bottom. Anyway, I felt like I had a lot in common with them, I mean, we all decided to move to Japan and teach and we liked similar things. Of course, had we not been under those circumstances, I dont think we ever wouldve been friends. And there were times when we got irritated at each other, but thats expected. at home Ive got a fianc and Im living with my parents while I get back on my feet, but I just feel so alone. I see my friends here maybe every 2-3 weeks, usually once a week. But its not the same. It feels so superficial, comparatively. We dont really talk about things. When we see each other its often food and games, but the deeper side of it feels lacking. Even within my family. I feel like no one listens. Everyone just wants to talk. Do you ever feel more lonely after coming home from being abroad? How do you cope with it? Any ideas as to why? Also, please share similar experiences if youd like. I think Id like to have some people to relate to!",1

5268,"Norwegian wont honor EU flight disruption laws because even though they searched for almost 4 hours they didnt find anything wrong with the plane.Tell me this is a joke. After a 4 hour delay (which caused me to cancel my connecting flight, book another flight and spend an unexpected night in London - transportation, hotel and food racked up in that bill) I was told I should be owed money by the airline. Made my claim 2 months ago and today they responded with this:
 Norwegian flight DI7054 (MCO-LGW) 02.08.2019 was delayed by 3 hours and 22 minutes due to an inspection of the aircraft following a possible technical fault. During inspection, no technical defect was found. The aircraft was then released for operation without the need to replace any components. This disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. we're unable to cover the expenses claimed as we're not liable for such costs. For information regarding the legal basis for the reimbursement of financial losses in the event of a flight disruption, please see below*.

 - Monteriggioni; I'm a sucker for walled towns. 

 - We'll probably stop by Colle Val d'Elsa, as it's pretty close to where we're staying. sure if we'll visit Siena or not; it looks lovely, but also rather large and crowded, and as we'll be coming from a few days in Florence, I think we'd rather stick to some smaller and more laid-back places.  other suggestions for places to see, good driving routes, etc. around that area?",1

My wife is more of a lay by the pool, get massages, tropical vacationer. Im more of a lets find a hiking or bike trail, go kayaking, and eat somewhere sketchy kind of guy. She also loves the outdoors, but would get burned out fast if every day revolves around it. thinking Vegas/Grand Canyon/Zion.  - We dont gamble, and my wife is sensitive to sound when trying to go to sleep. Nothing would ruin a trip faster than not being able to fall asleep because it sounds like a party until 4am. Ive read that Vegas still has a lot to offer even for people who dont gamble. Shed love to catch a few shows, lay by the pool, sightsee, and hit up a spa. Ive been looking at hotels but the sheer number of them is overwhelming for me.  Canyon/Zion - where do you start? If we were to spend one day at each, where in each would you go? Say we spend 3 days in Vegas, then head to the first one on the 4th day, where would you stay in between? Camping outdoors is NOT an option for my wife, but she would do a cabin if thats an option. Is one day at each even enough? options-  Diego/Joshua Tree - she has family in San Diego and says its the best weather in the country. I dont know enough about Joshua Tree to know if its worth designing a trip around.  - obviously would check off the tropical box, and would be able to fit in all the outdoor activities Id want. Dont know which islands are preferable and I assume it would cost much, much more than a Vegas vacation.  open to any other suggestions.",1

5448,"Small Day Bag Recomendations Please!Hello everyone! looking for a bit of advice to steer me in the right direction. What I am looking for is a smallish day bag with some compartments/separations for when I am traveling.  try to travel carry-on a most of the time as I live in Europe and it is so easy to hop around with cheap flights without waiting or paying for a checked bag. Train and car trips happen sometimes too. My main bag is a Farpoint 40 (I am getting a Nomatic Travel Bag soon as the Farpoint just didnt have the options I wanted to stay organised) but I need a smaller bag for during the day at locations. Also, I would like it to be small enough to be considered a personal item when I fly so I can have it in addition to my carry-on when necessary.  last bag I used for this was an Osprey Stuff Pack which was ok but it is a bit too flimsy, has basically no separate compartments, and it doesnt breath at all on the back cause it is made of a waterproof material. The size was great though (website says 18L), and I could even go smaller if I was to have a more solid bag and still pass it as my personal item. Basically I would use this bag during the day to carry maybe a sweatshirt (or rain jacket), water, snacks, and small items I might buy during the day.  thing, I am not really a colours guy. Nothing bright and a black or dark grey would be great. Something that even matches my Nomatic when I get it. The bag doesnt have to be super sturdy as I would like to be able to pack it in my main bag if I have to so something pretty flexible and thinner. Not as thin as the Osprey Stuff Sack though! let me know your suggestions and I can give feedback to narrow things down.",1

5475,"A Modern-Day QuestI hope this is allowed here. I'm a Creative-Writing student in my 3rd year at Bangor University, Wales. For my dissertation I've chosen to do a creative non-fiction piece of adventure writing. Issue is, to get the high marks, I need to make it stand out - not an easy thing to do in a genre defined by the crazy exploits of authors.   
Here's my plan: People constantly find it weird that I can enjoy travel and the outdoors so much whilst also being massive nerd. Usually I respond by saying that it's all about a shared love of adventure - the kick I get out of following Frodo's quest in Lord Of The Rings is the same as the one that can be found in a multi-day hiking exped for example. I want to build on this concept by going on a quest of my own, starting in Wales and delivering an item across land and sea to a far-off destination - in as reasonable a time as possible, given the restraints of uni work and, dare I say it, Brexit.  
 anyone in the UK reads this and has an item they want delivering to somewhere in Europe, free of charge, please get in contact. It could be that you're a European student studying here and you want to send a letter home, or maybe you've got a friend in the continent you want to send a birthday present to. Anything works. This is the first step of my plan, and frankly I don't intend to put too much thought in to the whole process. The aim is to get a goal, pack my bag, and go - spending as little money along the way as possible. Thank you for reading.

 I travel often to Poland, this time I was brought to the rather interesting city of Gniezno. Therefore, I want to share with you a photo of a rather interesting hare that he met in his streets. I arrived in Gnezgo and started the walk through the city, I started to find quite interesting figures of a hare on its streets. Which I really liked. The Nest became 3 myth where I met similar figures after Wroclaw and the Green Gura



 You can find him in different images around the city. Near the theater, the former small barracks and the city center.  
Walking around the city itself, it becomes more interesting and exciting when you get excited about exploring the city streets in search of images of a hare. 



  rabbits sculptures, which speak of the most important moments in the city's history, will become a ""guide"" between the individual elements of the emerging Royal Way. are rabbits depicted in sculpture?""  
Well, we explain that the etymology of the Polish word ""rabbit"" is associated with the word ""king"" in German. All in all, there are 15 figures of these fascinating rabbits in the city  
More information about rabbit placement is available in the mobile application ""Rabbit Chase""! implementation of this project began on January 5, 2018 and ended in November. The main objective of the project was to make the city more attractive to tourists.  
Because Gniezno is of rather sacred importance to Poland, mainly because it was the first capital of Poland and the construction of the Polish state began.

If we are did Christmas in Paris, our itinerary would look something like this:  

 17th :** Land in Paris at night  
**Dec 18th - Dec 25th (8 days) :** Paris  
**Dec 26th - Dec 29th (4 days) :** Barcelona  
**Dec 30th - Jan 2nd (4 days) :** Florence  
**Jan 3rd - Jan 6th (4 days) :** Rome  
**Jan 7th :** Fly out of Rome  

 we did Christmas in Barcelona, we are thinking that we can fit in Venice or Naples into our itinerary. It would look something like this:  

 17th :** Land in Paris at night  
**Dec 18th - Dec 23rd (6 days) :** Paris   
**Dec 24th - Dec 27th (4 days) :** Barcelona   
**Dec 28th - Dec 30th (3 days) :** Florence/Venice or Naples  
**Dec 31st - Jan 2nd (3 days) :** Florence/Venice or Naples  
**Jan 3rd - Jan 6th (4 days) :** Rome  
**Jan 7th :** Fly out of Rome  

 are your thoughts for Christmas time in Barcelona and Paris? I know that places aren't necessarily open or will only have half days on Dec 24th & 25th and the same with the Jan 1st. We are just trying to figure out which cities we would have a better shot at enjoying ourselves in.   

 what do you think about our itinerary in general? Does it sound OK and is there anything I should change or consider?

The [schedule for Moscow - Petropavlovsk]( seems fine - there's a train 090 on 14 Dec. However the [schedule for Petropavlovsk - Almaty]( stops after 8 Dec, does anyone know why? (Planning to transfer onto train 706). Are there just no more trains or will the timetable be updated sometime in the future? the 706T train is not available after 8 Dec, does anyone have any route suggestions for Moscow-Almaty around 13/14 Dec? Russian railways search engine doesn't return anything as the date is too far in the future. I'd like to have a planned route asap for visa application.  question I have is about the Russian visa. I'm not sure if I'll need a single or double entry visa, as I've heard some trains in Russia dip in and out of Kazakhstan. As I'm not sure of the route I'm taking from Moscow to Almaty, should I apply for a double-entry Russian visa just to be safe? I don't need a visa for Kazakhstan. When I [just put Moscow to Almaty in the Russian railways search engine]( and tick ""route with transfer"", I can only search for trains up to 5 Nov and see available trains. If I put dates later than 5 Nov the Petropavlovsk-Almaty leg says sold out.

Doing some idle Googling in a 'what could I have done kind of way,' I've discovered how cheap AirBnBs are in and around Hanoi.    always wanted to visit and explore Vietnam - specifically, the North. But I don't see myself as the backpacking type. I like my own space, a 'base' to return to, somewhere I can follow my own little routine and pace of life.   the idea of renting an apartment with facilities (kitchen, wifi... aircon) is very appealing. I can enjoy the city, do the touristy thing... but retreating into my own little bubble is great too.    would serve a quadruple purpose; enjoyment of exploring a culture and history I'm very interested in, dipping a toe into the idea of living permanently abroad, looking at the cost of living, even with flights and accommodation it would be cheaper than my living arrangements in the UK (I don't own a house)... and tax reasons (I'll get it back if I spend another couple of months out of the UK in a tax year.)       a TLDR: I want to live in/near Hanoi for a couple of months. So, anyone with experience of the area;      Is an AirBnB going to be the best option for what I want? (Basically, an apartment... I'm used to small cabins on ships, so the compact/studio nature of the ones in my budget 300-400 a month wouldn't bother me) Are there any other options I should consider?       What area of the city/suburbs? I do enjoy the hustle and bustle of busy cities (I've been to lots of them with work!)... but a quieter suburb to retreat to might be nice if it has good transport links to get into the city. Or, parts of the city that are quieter? I've read the Old Quarter might have a (slightly) slower pace of life?    in advance!",1

5598,"Mixing Business and Personal TravelHi All, potentially taking a business trip to Dublin Ireland from New Jersey later this year and looking to piggyback off this to get some personal travel around Europe in while I'm over there. The general plan is as follows: Book roundtrip airfare between Newark and Dublin that departs November 30th and returns December 15th through the company. Book a hotel in Dublin with check in December 1st (the flights I'm seeing all take off November 30th and land December 1st due to the time difference) and check out December 7th through the company and work in our Dublin office for the week. Leave Dublin December 8th and travel around Ireland, Scotland, England, and potentially the Netherlands for a week, all on my own dime. Make it back to Dublin for my flight home on the 15th. checked with my manager and this won't be a problem from a company perspective. What I'm trying to figure out is if I can link my personal travel back to Dublin for the 15th with my subsequent company flight home. Ideally I'd stay in London the night of the 14th and then fly London -> Dublin first thing in the morning and then get my Dublin -> Newark, but the earliest London -> Dublin lands at 9am and the latest Dublin -> Newark I could take leaves at 12pm and 3 hours seems dangerous in terms of time to allow me to land, get my bags and then go back through security. If I book my London -> Dublin on the same airline as my Dublin -> Newark will I be able to link them afterwards such that it's just a normal transfer in Dublin and I don't need to get my bags or anything and just go to the new gate, even though the flights are from two separate reservations?",1

The only problem is that she's 65 years old with two artificial hips, so I can't exactly  bring her on the multi-day, high elevation hikes I plan to be doing while I'm not on a bus.

If at all possible, I want to avoid reporting the trip to US authorities, and having to travel under one of the eleven approved categories, having to save receipts, etc.  I am under the impression that I cannot leave the United States on a German passport, just as I cannot enter the US on a German passport. Does this mean I should book the travel from Canada and avoid the US entirely?

My experience has been terrible. story short, they are saying the airline changed the time of the first flight so we can't make the second one. They say they have to give us new flights. are trying to give me flights from Rome to Helsinki on Dec 20, which is two days before the original date that I booked for. really messes up our plans for a number of reasons and we want to fly on Dec 22, the day that we booked in the beginning. still, they are now saying that I'm not allowed to cancel or receive a refund because they are providing me with an ""alternative flight option."" But the alternative is nonsense, it's a full 48 hours before the time I originally booked. are my options here? Is this even legal? Are they not required to give me a new flight on the same day that I booked?

5705,"Seeking advice about what do to after a difficult Couchsurfing experience...So, Ive just had an Couchsurfing experience and Im not sure how I feel about it/what I should do. Im quite new to the platform so would really appreciate some advice.  Im currently in an area of the world where theres not much tourism infrastructure (no hostels or anything), and so Ive started to use Couchsurfing for the first time.  was in a small town last night, where there were only one or two Couchsurfing hosts. I picked a guy that had a mostly blank profile, but 4-5 really good references, all of which said that he spoke good English and that he was happy to show them around his town. He was really friendly when we were communicating beforehand, and seemed to be a nice guy.  I arrived to the town and he said that I should meet him later on in the afternoon in a cafe. I wandered around for a bit before meeting him at the agreed time. We met and had a bit of food, and he then said that hed show me a really cool castle nearby that was hard to get to if you didnt know the particular route. This was a really amazing, beautiful site, which I was really pleased to see.  this, we went back to a restaurant and spent the evening chatting and eating and drinking tea. He was super hospitable and chatty over this evening - really friendly, and we had a good time together. The restaurant was kind of a family owned thing, so we slept on the roof of the hotel. (Not an uncommon thing in this country, I should add).  next morning, over breakfast, he asked if we could talk about deals, meaning that he expected money for showing me around. He hadnt mentioned this once before, and there was nothing on his profile whatsoever that suggested he expected money as a guide. As total price for showing me around the previous evening as well as this forthcoming morning/afternoon, he offered a price of 100, which I managed to bargain down to 45. Again, I was slightly surprised that hed suddenly brought a proper price into the equation, but he offered to take me to a few more cool sights, so I like of reluctantly agreed to 45. I should also add that the people of his town are in kind of a difficult situation owing to government projects, so I do feel sorry for him.  he takes me around the sights, and as were going to have lunch before I leave, he asks about payment. I say ok, we agreed on 45, so Ill just get the money now. He then starts to get funny with me, saying that he always charges more and starts trying to guilt trip me into paying more, saying that - at the very least - I should pay for his food at lunch, which I agree to, just because I dont want to get into an argument. We then go back the restaurant where my things were, where they foot me with another pretty large bill - covering both me and him for lunch and breakfast, as well a few drinks and things. I pay and leave to get the bus to another city. As Im leaving, he follows me and tries to guilt trip me into buying something from his friends shop, which I refuse to do.  atmosphere was pretty frosty when we said goodbye.  Im not sure what I should do. Should I leave a negative review or report him? Or should I just forget about it?  as I understand it, is not meant to be a place for tour guides to find customers, particularly if they do not openly say that they are tour guides until after they have given you their time. I ended up parting ways with about $60, which isnt a totally insignificant amount of money for me, and Im feeling a bit confused and upset about the whole situation.  do you guys think?  for your time.",1
5706,"Are Toronto and Montreal accessible and accommodating with a 1 year old child?My wife and I are looking to spend two weeks in Canada next May, and we're going to bring along our daughter (she'll be 16 months by then) but we're conscious of potential difficulties in bringing her.   always said we never want the choice of having a child to stop us doing what we like to do, and what we like to do is explore cities, take in the culture, visit the local attractions, eat and drink like locals do etc. We're thinking of Toronto as my wife has family in Caledon and we'd like to visit Montreal. We'll also visit Niagra falls and will likely try and do a National Park, maybe Mont Tremblant. sure Niagra and a National Park will be fine, but it's exploring the cities, going into bars and restaurants that i'm more conscious about. For example, if the cities are anything like walking around in New York, i'd hesitate in bringing a stroller along, and i'm not sure if it's culturally acceptable to bring such a young child into a bar or restaurant with their own packed lunch like we could do in a similar set up here in London. appreciate your thoughts and hopefully reassure me it'll be no problem!",1
5707,"Looking for location suggestions for someone with limited mobility who likes relaxing destinations traveling with a spouse who is looking for more excitementMy mom and her husband are planning for a potential trip they would like to take at some point next summer. The duration of the trip would probably be about a week. My mom has some disabilities that make walking extended distances or on surfaces that aren't flat difficult, so any locations need to be good for someone who has difficulty spending too much time on their feet. Her husband is basically the opposite and would like a location where he can explore nature and go hiking. They both like sightseeing and my mom was hoping to find somewhere that they can spend some time sightseeing by car together that is near a beach or some cute towns that she could easily check out while he goes hiking. mom likes:** beaches cute towns
* sightseeing from a car or some other type of guided tour that doesn't require much walking husband likes:** outdoor activities
* nature
* cultural landmarks
* sightseeing
 
Preferably there would be a location where they can do stuff together at least some of the time. I suggested Hawaii thinking they could do some tours by boat or helicopter and drive around the island together, and then my mom could spend time by the beach or shopping while her husband hikes some of the days, but Hawaii is too far for her. She would prefer a plane ride to be about 4 hours at a time or less, but could potentially do up to 8 or so max. They would be flying out of Philadelphia or somewhere in the surrounding area. suggestions so far:** Yellowstone and Grand Teton while staying in Jackson: they can drive around and explore together, she can probably walk some of the easier boardwalk areas, she would enjoy Jackson, and he would have plenty of hiking paths to explore
- Costa Rica: her friend went there recently and didn't enjoy it so she would want to hear from people who did. I figured there's plenty of beaches for her and nature for him
- Lake Tahoe: Beaches and a cute town her for, nature and outdoor activities for him North America, she's also considering Vancouver Island as a potential destination. I suggested Mexico, but her husband isn't interested. is also considering either Spain or Italy. They traveled to Europe earlier in their marriage and really loved the cities and towns, the architecture, and the coasts, and they would like to go back if she is able to make the plane ride. Any suggestions for places in Europe are appreciated aswell!",1

I've decided to take a side trip outside of the city which will interfere with a planned visit to the famous Park Gell (a paid ticket is required for the Regulated Zone). I bought my ticket online through Ticketbar. An email to them requesting that the date be pushed forward by a few days resulted in this reply: are very sorry to read that from you. Unfortunately, our partner is very strict and does not accept any changes or cancellation on tickets already sent to the customer.""* to cover my bases, I had also sent an email to Park Gell through their website, mentioned on the e-ticket from Ticketbar, quoting ONLY the reservation number on the VERY official-looking e-ticket provided by Ticketbar. That email made the same request to bump the date forward a few days. Their reply: regards to your request, we regret to inform you that we are not able to modify your tickets, as you bought them through the website of a third party whom we have no commercial agreements with. Therefore, we recommend you to contact them so they can offer you a solution.""* considerations: Ticketbar refers to Park Gell as ""partner"", Park Gell disavows any partnership
* The ticket, provided by Ticketbar is, indeed VERY official-looking. It actually states (yes, I just noticed!) that:*""ONLY TICKETS PURCHASED ON THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE* [*parkguell.barcelona*]( *WILL BE VALID. Park Gell reserves the right to refuse any ticket that has not bee issued by the official website. Park Gell has no agreements with third parties and only sells tickets through* [*parkguell.barcelona*](
* How did the folks at Park Gell know the ticket was purchased from a third party? Just by the reservation number?
* Ticketbar sells their tickets online for 10.00 -- the same price as on the Park Gell website. I buy a fake ticket? I be denied entry? is this crazy relationship between ""partner"" and ""third party whom we have no commercial agreements with""? suggestions on how to compel either party to move the date of the damn ticket? update:** It's only been a few minutes since I posted (a handful of hours since the original emails from them) and maybe an hour since a small barrage of emails back from me to both parties. Ticketbar has just replied with the following: accept our sincerest apologies for the whole situation.*

>*We kindly inform you that we have now issued a refund of your Park Guell tickets. Please be aware that the transaction may take a few days.*

But if there's somewhere else we can  go to the reef from, we'd be open to that since not much else in Cairns  interests us!  
 not hikers or backpackers - so 3-4 day hikes and camping don't interest us. We basically like a well-rounded enjoyable trip - we're not generally museum/winery/arts/food/shopping ppl - we like to sample all that stuff but don't want to base any stops around it if that makes sense!   
 really am drawn to Kangaroo Island for some reason and the more remoteness/just exploring around. That's the only part of the trip where we would want to drive if possible.

Details inside.I don't have many friends and the few that I do have don't seem super into travelling so I've been thinking about just [Doing it myself]( can go either anytime in December or in the first 2 weeks of January. I'm a 25 y.o guy and I've been to Egypt (a really long time ago when I was a kid so I hardly remember much), Dubai which was nice the first 2 times I went with my family but honestly I find it a bit boring and artificial. I've been to Bali which was really nice and chilled and Malaysia as well albeit only for about 3 days. The last place I visited was Turkey which I absolutely loved. I loved every bit and every aspect of it. The people, the culture, the history, the cities, the scenery, the location, the food, everything. Honestly one of my favourite places. I was in Istanbul and Izmir and got to see most of the sites at the time. general I love history and sight seeing. I love going to places learning about their pasts and what it's like in the present. I enjoy chilling and taking in some breathtaking scenery, I also love getting lost in a city. Walking out of your hotel and just wandering around exploring hidden gems and finding cool things and places scattered across the city, meeting new people and experiencing new cultures. I want a bit of an adventurous trip but also with some time to take a step back, breath and take things in. from South Africa so my mine problem is flights. While there's no shortage of flights going all across the world North and South America as well as some parts of Asia are out of the question as flights can cost upwards of R18 000 ($1200) which is 3 times more than what I earn in a month. I've been saving for a bit so I have around R20-30 000 set aside that I can use although I'd prefer to use as little of it as possible. I'm not bothered by fancy hotels so I don't mind staying in an Airbnb, a bit of a whole in the wall or even a hostel  so long as my bed is fairly clean, the bathrooms are fairly hygienic and my stuff is safe. initially had my heart set in Georgia (Tbilisi) but after doing research I learnt the weather isn't that great around December so even though the city may look nice its super cold so you miss out on a lot of the things to do and places to go. I don't have anywhere particular in mind atm but I figured Africa and Europe might be the cheapest places for me to visit rn although I'm open to any and all suggestions.

In this new series of weekly threads we want to focus on regions that have a lot to offer to travellers: the towns, nature, and other interesting places whether they are lesser or more known. If more known provide more in depth suggestions like tours, things to do, places to eat, etc.  contribute all and any questions / thoughts / suggestions / ideas / stories / highlights about this travel destination, whether it be places you want to see or experiences you have had. post will be [archived on our wiki destinations page]( and linked in the sidebar for future reference, so please direct any of the more [repetitive questions]( there. Please click [here]( for list and dates of future destinations. If you notice an area of a region is not listed it is likely it will be a future topic or it may have been a prior topic as a country or city. Please focus on the specific regions in the submission unless it was not a [prior or future topic.]( guideline:** If you link to an external site, make sure it's relevant to helping someone travel to this city. Please include adequate text with the link explaining what it is about and describing the content from a helpful travel perspective. **Example:** We really enjoyed the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. It was $35 each, but there's enough to keep you entertained for whole day. Bear in mind that parking on site is quite pricey, but if you go up the hill about 200m there are three $15/all day car parks. [Monterey Aquarium](

5799,"Canada in winter - transport dilemmaI'm heading to Canada from 26/12/2019-19/01/2020. Some background info on me: 26F from QLD Australia (relevant to question) story short, I have regrets from previous travel experiences and I'm finding it very difficult to find bus services at a reasonable price to the places I want to go in Canada. I'm heading to Lake Louise to snowboard in the final week of my trip and have already decided it is best to fly there from Vancouver.  the other 2 weeks before I go to LL, I'm seriously considering hiring a car. I'm planning on staying in Whistler for New Years (possibly with a friend) and I also want to visit a friend in Vernon. I regret not being able to go wherever the hell I wanted whenever I wanted when I went to Europe and I'm concerned that I will get ""stuck"" and FOMO if I have to rely on public transport. The cost of said transport will also stack up so it's looking like either option will cost the same at this point. question is, do you think hiring a car is a good option? Please consider that I have never driven in proper winter conditions with snow/ice etc. I would say that I am a very good and experienced driver (I've never had an accident, open road and rural driving is normal for me being an Aussie that has travelled a fair bit in Aus). My only concern is snow and ice.  anyone here come from a, let's face it, non-winter place and driven in winter conditions? What was your experience like and did you adapt quickly to the conditions? way, I'm way too keen and just want to experience as many places as I can!",1

5825,"2 months in Central/South America - Itinerary Ideas ?Hi all. travelling for two months to Central and South America with my partner. We have booked a flight from Toronto, Canada to Mexico City on October 15th and have a flight from Santiago, Chile to Sydney, Australia on December 19th. So pretty much have two months to an awesome holiday in Central and South America. have a rough idea for where we want to go, but have not booked anything except our first two nights in Mexico City. We know there is much to do and see in a short time of two months, that will include long times travelling on buses too. Our budget is moderate, staying in mainly hostels but also we will stay in cheap hotels or resorts. Haven't formed much of a plan after Mexico but we'll be following the main touristy routes I'd say. We have both done basic Spanish lessons to help along the way also. order of countries and rough timings is: Mexico (3 weeks), Belize (1 week), Guatemala (5 days), Costa Rica (2 weeks), Panama (3 days), Columbia (1.5 weeks), Peru (1 night only for transfer), Chile (3 nights). plan for Mexico is: Fly into Mexico City, then go west to Guadalajara, then to Puerto Vallarta, then fly to Oaxaca, then go to Cancun (Not sure whether fly or long buses and stay along the way), then bus from Cancun to Belize. anyone have any itinerary ideas or must see places or thoughts? Also any areas to avoid due to security or tourist traps etc? Would be much appreciated!",1

2. One trip to Iceland (11 days) + Tenerife (10 days) in November = $1200 - Icelandair + Norwegian can be reversed since the music group is also playing at Zurich November 20th when I have a 20 hours layover and I could try to attend, but whatever... trip including the two destinations cost less, but at the same time, discovering the Canary Islands in 10 days seem a bit crazy. you recommend me to pay more for two full trips instead of trying to merge the two destinations? you",1

- artsy/ craft stuff: pottery/ceramics/tea museums, or any studio visits/workshops. We are fascinated by things like how those expensive Japanese papers are made. We also saw a video of how Japanese handmade denim came together
- easy to get around via walking and public transportation. Occasional cycling may be ok. Neither of us got a drivers license.
- some nature scene - not too far from the city - would be nice, though my boyfriend isnt a huge fan of hiking. So more like a nice stroll around a giant park would be better

It's a lovely city and well worth many visits. We had a free weekend and some extra Marriott points so we decided to head up to Vancouver on short notice.   
We had a free certificate for any Marriott property to a max of 35,000 points. On such short notice the only one that we could get that was reasonable was the [Civic Hotel]( in Surrey City Centre. We had never stayed in Surrey before and thought it would be fun to explore. The Civic Hotel was really really nice. Very fancy for Surrey. It is located right on the Skytrain and very convenient if you are arriving in Metro Vancouver from Seattle. Surrey has a vision with this new neighbourhood that in x years it is going to be like Yaletown in Vancouver. All glass condos and fancy restaurants. It is not quite there yet. I can see where they are headed and maybe they'll get there. For now, it is a lovely hotel in a bit of an odd location. Being on the Skytrain was a plus for sure.   
My wife is Indian and Surrey is the place to be for all things Indian in Metro Vancouver. When she heard we were staying in Surrey she took over the restaurant planning.   [Saravanaa Bhavan]( \- we went to this South Indian vegetarian restaurant for Saturday lunch buffet. Wonderful! My wife is from Andhra Pradesh in India and tucked in for her fill of comfort food. She was very happy with the authenticity of the food and I was the only white guy in the place.
2. [Tandoori Flame]( \- dinner buffet was here and the buffet was massive with great veg and meat options. The price was $10 more than Saravanaa but worth it for the variety.
3. [Navraj Sweets & Restaurant]( \- we really did not have any more room to eat at this point. We did stop here for 2 pounds of jalebi which they made fresh for us. We waited 15 min and received the warm jalebi and a couple samosas to go. So so good! take on Surrey is that this is the place to go in Metro Vancouver for Indian food. Yes, there are loads of Indian restaurants in Vancouver proper and they will be good but Surrey has become an Indian town. The food is awesome and worth the visit.   
While Surrey is Indian, Richmond has long been Chinese. We went to the [Richmond Night Market]( and were blown away. Think of the food stalls at any festival but with 2-3x the number of stalls and 90% of them are Asian. The food quality in variety and taste was wonderful. The crowd is there to E A T! The Richmond Night Market is open from May to October only so if you are looking to go head there soon. We had food from 4-5 stalls and then waddled back to the Skytrain to head out.  Thoughts**  
There is more to Metro Vancouver than Stanley Park, Granville Island, and the Capliano Suspension Bridge. People on here ask for hidden gems all the time. I would say the Asian food of Richmond and the Indian food of Surrey are tourist worthy!",1

I know that a lot of families in Mexico head for the resorts for the samanas santas and lots of places are sort of quiet (outside of the beaches and vacation destinations) but I think that GDL is a big enough city that there wont be a lack of things going on. Can anyone share their experiences. Also, since it's Easter, are there any other towns that really do *the most* for Easter? I think Mexican cultural heritage is really cool, we're going around easter just because of personal timing, I like to take language lessons and go to museums and markets when i travel, so if those are all going to be closed I will rethink the timing of my trip.  but, i think it's a good opportunity to see some cultural traditions too maybe.

5972,"Seeking Advice on Italy's Amalfi Coast vs Cinque TerreHey! I'm trying to plan a trip to Italy for May 2020 and one thing I keep getting really stuck on is incorporating the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre.For some context, my husband and I already have flights booked (he was so impatient to just get it on our calendars!) so I am working within a fixed time table of 13 full days (to be clear, this excludes the day we arrive and the day leave - Rome airports for both). these 13 days, I am unsure if it is wise or recommended to go to both Amalfi and Cinque Terre. I understand they aren't close, but from things I've read, it is possible.Then again, they are both coastal, beachy areas right? Is it redundant to do both? If one would feel like a repeat of the other and I'd be better served spending those days elsewhere, which one should we go to? My husband and I like exploring (we can handle, maybe even welcome, lots of walking) such as sight-seeing the unique and gorgeous landscapes, and architecture. We enjoy the beach, but maybe not to sunbathe all day :). And my husband is pretty interested in some of the history, which is one draw for Amalfi because it's close to Pompeii.And we do plan on spending several days in Rome, it's the rest I can't iron out! if that's long winded. I would appreciate any advice or just food-for-thought that you have!Thank you so much!",1

5982,"Travel AdviceI'm gonna lay out my situation for y'all because background info is always helpful. a senior in college graduating a semester early this fall. I'm returning to the university in May 2020 for graduation, but for the spring semester it looks like I'm heading home to Dallas, TX to stress about my future/apply for jobs/travel. date, I haven't traveled nearly as much as I would've like to. I'm 22, and aside from a semester abroad during the Spring 2018 semester that took me to Israel, Jordan, Spain, Romania, and Cyprus, I've never traveled outside the US. There are also plenty of destinations domestically I've never seen. would love to spend somewhere between 1-4 weeks in the winter/spring and go hike somewhere. Cities are nice, but they're not the focus. I'm looking for jaw-dropping nature scenes that take my breath away. I would go anywhere in the world theoretically, but safety and cost are important to me. Don't have an exact budget yet, but if I had to guess, I bet it'd be between $1,000-$2,000. Cheaper is better unless it's a destination I absolutely cannot miss. Could probably stretch a few extra hundred if justifiable. love to leave the country again, but I'm open to amazing hikes in the Southwest, Cali, Utah, Pacific Northwest as well. Iceland and Norway have always been on my bucket list too, but I figured they're either too cold that time of year or too pricy. important note: I'm probably traveling alone. Most of my friends will still be in school and my family will be working, so unless I join a tour or travel group (which I'm not entirely opposed to), this will be a solo thing. may be going somewhere already the week of March 15th-22nd, but besides this week, I'm open to anything timing wise between mid-January and late April. to review my travel stipulations: Nature-focused hiking trip
* Budget is $1,000-$2,000 (little bit more if I really needed it)
* US and Europe come to mind first, but open to anything aside from Israel/Middle East again
* Solo trip or join a group tour
* Any dates between mid-Jan & late April aside from the week in the middle of March
* Would happily do multiple hikes in different destinations if affordable and all suggestions and general pieces of advice are welcome. Please help me figure something out Reddit!",1

6129,"Canada working holiday visa or travelling? Need advice please!So I've been desperate to quit my job and travel for a while now. I'm so fed up of the 9 to 5 and just want to feel like i'm actually living. I've been invited to apply for a Canada working holiday visa and at first I was buzzing about it, but then thinking about how much it's going to cost me to do it makes me realise that I could save the same amount and go travelling for 4/5 months around South East Asia without having to work. just worried that if I move to Canada, I'll end up back in a 9 to 5, won't have much time to travel (mainly because it's such a big place) and also won't have a lot of money as I'd like to move to Vancouver and I've heard how expensive it is.  are so many places in the world I want to see and I'm 30 next year, so I'd like to do as much as I can in the next two years before I think about settling down a bit. I'm also a bit limited as to how much I can save atm as I rent privately and don't have the best wage. I could probably save about 6,000 max between now and feb/march next year. do you think would be my best bet? Any advice from people who have done both options would be ideal please!",1

6137,"5 or 10 days in NYC during January?Hi all! boyfriend and I will be travelling across North America in December-January, and NY is our final destination before returning to Australia. Our main dilemma is whether to spend 6 or 10 nights in NY (we are arriving at dinner time on the first day so it doesn't really count). have wanted to travel to NY since I was a pre-teen, and love the cold weather as it is a big change from back home. We set ourselves a $6,000 budget each for our trip (insurance, accommodation, flights but excluding food, entertainment), and have currently gone over that by a few hundred dollars. dilemma is this: due to differences in the price of flights between days, we can either spend 6 nights in NY or 10 nights for only $100 more each in accommodation \[flight much cheaper leaving after 10 nights so it evens out to only be a $100 difference\]. We cannot leave after 8 days, for example, because the price for the flight on that date is significantly more expensive. it will push the budget higher than just that $100 in accommodation because we will be spending money on food, entertainment etc for another few days. We both still live with our parents so we are lucky enough not to have money dictate our decisions at this point in our lives, but are finishing college soon and are hoping to still have some money in our savings. would you do?",1

4 days in Switzerland (Zurich)
12 days in Italy (Florence, Rome, Venice, Naples)
5 days in France (Paris)
6 days in UK (London) schedule is fully booked in (I know, we picked expensive cities. Next time well use a travel agent!). Flights, accommodation, major train trips, expensive day trips/sights/tours have been booked. So essentially, all thats left to pay for is food, daily transport, small sightseeing fees, travellers tax and souvenirs. Id say were mid range - a young couple, will probably eat out twice daily, groceries for some meals and a glass of wine a couple of nights a week.  much money should we take EACH? Not including money for souvenir shopping.  had a ball park figure of a comfortable $6,000 AU (currently 3,700) for myself. Is that way over shooting it? Or do I need more in case of emergency?  appreciate your input!",1

6278,"Blamed for rental car damage two days after return[Names changed to protect players in the drama] frequently rent from a local Enterprise location near my home in Colorado. I know the manager (Bill) and many of the employees. my car had hail damage and my insurance covered a rental during repairs. Insurance sent me to my usual Enterprise location. When I picked up the rental I worked with a new (to me) employee, Sally, who gave me a hard sell on supplemental insurance. Seriously, she went on and on about rock chips, door dings, extra rental charges during any repairs, etc. Hardest sell job I've ever seen. I didn't buy it, she seemed miffed. returned the rental on a Saturday morning. Sally wasn't there. Quick & easy return, no damage noted, no extra charges. following Monday I got a call from Manager Bill. Mr. Smith, we've got a problem with the rental you returned Saturday. There's some undercarriage damage that wasn't discovered until today. Do you know anything about that? No, the car was fine while I had it, wasn't aware of anything wrong at any point. Well, there's some under-the-engine plastic parts dragging. Did you drive off-road or something? Never. I never heard or saw anything dragging or loose. When I checked the car with Sally before renting it we inspected the exterior, glass, the usual, but she and I didn't open the hood or get on our knees to look underneath. I've rented from you lots of times, and we've never done that. asked me to hold on, came back after a minute and said ""Mr. Smith, never mind, sorry to bother you. We'll take care of it, you won't see any extra charge."" this resolved itself, except for one nagging thing. I'm 100% certain the car had nothing dragging while I had it. Something happened to the car after I returned it. Someone screwed with the car, and I can't help thinking that Sally had something to do with it. was so strange, Enterprise trying to hold me responsible for damage found days later. this ring a bell with anyone?",1

From what Im reading, the word vegetarian mostly is taken to mean that one just doesnt eat red meat.  Eggs and milk are fine, but we dont eat fish/other meat, lard, fish stock, bone broth, etc. Essentially, if something directly died as a part of creating the food or the ingredients, we avoid it.   think Ive got the translation for ovo-lacto vegetarian but I figure many people may not know what that means. If I told people in the US title, most would have no clue.**    anyone help me with the translation? We will probably just bring this with us and show the restaurant employees. Many thanks!",1

6344,"Travelling SEA in crutches - advice neededHiya, I'm due to leave for 9 weeks in SEA next Monday, planning to arrive in Bangkok, and travel in Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam and a short visit to Angkor Wat/Siem Reap. One of the main things I was looking forward to was trekking from Kalaw to Inle Lake which should be about 4 weeks in. In general I was looking forward to doing more outdoorsy things and realistically would be walking a lot. I'm travelling alone. a couple of weeks ago I injured my leg a bit and walking since hasn't been fun. I was at the doctors again today and they gave me some crutches saying it was a possible stress fracture but not showing up on x-rays.  They said it would be fine for me to still go just to rest up this week as much as possible, take an aspirin before every flight and to take the crutches with me. The nurse basically said the recovery is to rest as much as possible and ice it and I can do that when I get back. question is, has anyone done this or travelled with crutches before/met travellers with crutches? Will my trip still be doable? Is it silly to still go or should I see if  I can postpone? checked my travel insurance and they can refund me my flights for ""serious injury"" but I'm not sure if this would be covered, I'm not in cast and my doctors haven't given me any evidence for it. I was going to ring tomorrow to see what my options might be.",1

I always want to share it with someone, and Id love to share it with my SO.  this is a rant, because apart from this hes perfect and Im so lucky i met him and we have so much in common.

Especially if it's nature based and free/cheap (spent too much in Sydney bookings already! :P).  recommendations for the entire route is also welcomed. was also hoping to go camping somewhere on the trip, and wake up with the sunrise. I'm not 100% what the legalities are around camping in Australia and didn't want to disrespect the environment/locals in anyway so any advise there would be great. The camping advise doesn't necessarily have to be between the spots mentioned above, they can be for any point of the journey (between Sydney and Cairns). I'm only experienced with camping in England so any guidance about Aussie camping generally would be greatly appreciated. for taking the time! :)",1

6463,"Best Cities for Diverse International Food
*** Post has been edited to flow better as I wrote this jetlagged at 4AM this morning. just returned from a two week trip to Italy and was a bit surprised by the lack of diverse ethnic food. Of course we enjoyed many countless traditional dishes and had some absolutely incredible meals, but after a week or so I yearned for diversity.  The copious amounts of of the bread and cheese were wreaking havoc on my stomach as I am used to a primarily gluten and dairy free diet. I wanted to find another option as at home I eat food from many countries. When I am home in the states I enjoy Peruvian, Greek, Thai, or Vietnamese when I eat out and only rarely American food.  I was in Italy of course, but wanted food from another culture. we stopped in Genoa for our last night before heading home I was thrilled. There was a street (rather shady) called Via Pre which is home to mainly immigrants and for around a mile I saw countless African, Latin and Arabic countries represented with a restaurant. We ended up getting some Mexican that was decent, but more authentic than another place I tried in Naples. talking with several local about this subject, they told me that Italians are typically conservative and not as open minded towards trying new cuisines. Even to the point where mayors will not allow new ethnic restaurants to open up in certain cities. had a similar experience when I visited Spain with Iberico ham literally everywhere. The food was amazing there as well. But funny enough one of our best meals was at a Jamaican restaurant. My partner and I often miss chicken when in Europe as it seems that EVERYONE eats mainly red meat when out at restaurants. The jerk chicken was so tasty and ended up being one of our favorite meals of the trip prompts me to ask, where have you visited where you have found an impressive diverse ethnic restaurant scene. I love sampling foods of the local culture, but after a certain time I need to eat something new. Where should I visit next to find the kinds of options I am looking for?",1

I was going inside my room when I saw her and one of her female employees standing in the driveway, whispering. As soon as the owner saw me, she stopped  talking and waited until I was out of earshot to resume talking. 10 mins later, I thought I heard somebody say my name outside my room so I opened the door, only to find an employee (who was being really nosy and asking me all kinds of personal questions the day before) and a girl standing in front of the door and whispering. Then the employee sighed and walked away without saying anything. I was confused.  2 hours later, I came back to find my bag opened. Although nothing went missing, I am pretty sure I left my bag closed when I left the room. I being paranoid? I don't know what to think.",1

Concerned that so far my research highlights a lot of sightseeing, but less ""sightdoing,"" but I've only just begun to investigate. is 8 days enough time? Probably not.  spent a few hours in Petra once, know there's clearly a lot more country to see. own hemisphere is sporting really high airfare for that week which is why there are no central or south American countries on the list. I'm not averse to long flights, but I worry that Asia is too far for a week. Ideas? Suggestions? All would be much appreciated. Price is a consideration, but not a preventative.

The problem is these are not fully guaranteed unlike a regular rental and is through a third party site such as imoova.com or [transfercar.com]( and not directly with the rental company, if that particular vehicle is not available or fit for travel for any reason there is usually no substitute, thus if you had made travel plans on hotel, airfare, etc before or after the transfers as these are one way rentals and alternative arrangements are necessary to get back than it would go to waste. I see that Imoova recommends taking out travel insurance for these transfers to cover any unexpected issues that might come up, though do you know any travel insurance that covers such circumstances should travel be delayed or cancelled due to issues between the site and the rental company or issues with that particular rental vehicle?",1

If so, which region or regions should we focus on? What towns we should set as our base to explore the region(s)? Or should we pick a new town every night, especially if we want to do the Ring Road.
We are budget travelers, so are not interested in spending too much on accommodation. Yes, we know the high costs in Iceland, so we are realistic, yet dont need the bells and whistles when it comes to sleeping arrangements. We have not  ruled out renting a camper van.

I've always tried asking immigration officers to stamp on an existing page with room and while some of them do it, many of them just open a random page and stamp there (I'm looking at you, Canada, Spain, and Portugal). It's incredibly frustrating to have an entire page wasted with a single stamp.  worse yet, other countries don't even bother stamping (Croatia, Bosnia), and that creates a different sort of headache.  telling them to stamp where there's a bookmark has been incredible. They open and the first page that comes up is the bookmark and it's easy enough. So far it's worked out great! Only downside is that it's magnetic so triggers the metal detector.

We got lots of views of the oceans, mountains, waterfalls, etc...but we really only find that stuff interesting for about the time it takes to take a photo. We made our way to Tofino and rented surfboards...that is clearly when we started to really enjoy ourselves. realized we both like to be physically involved in activities.

So far we've been looking at Koh Ngai, which seems to be the most popular in the area, but we are wondering if anyone who has traveled to the area has any more suggestions. We are looking for a quiet beach vacation, so no bucket filled full moon parties. Not really keen on staying in tents but we don't need super expensive beach resorts.  Tried to find some stuff that was previously posted but the last Thailand destination guide that I could find was posted in 2015 and mostly focused on the coup d'etat. And the weekly discussion guide was posted 5 years ago, and we all know how much things can change within 5 years.",1

 I've read that Frigiliana, Ronda, Olvera, Antequera and Vejer de La Frontera are all very beautiful. The villages in the Alpujurras also seem interesting. Has anyone been to one or more of these places, did you have a favourite place and why? this trip i would like to see the Cordoba patios during the festival in May + spend 2? days in Seville + visit one of the Pueblos blancos + visit another place (granada, cadiz, nerja or somewhere a little less under the radar?) will be getting around by public transport so would have to factor that in and would ideally fly in to madrid or seville and fly out of another airport.  enjoy trying different food and drinks, wandering around local neighborhoods with quaint or interesting buildings, visiting parks/gardens and enjoy coastal areas (but not a must for this trip if it doesn't align with the itinerary). I love offbeat experiences (once had a beer bath in Tyrol) and try to avoid places that have become a tourist trap (in the opinion of those that I have asked).  that this is a long winded, I'm new to Reddit and appreciate any advice.

Were heading to Turkey and then onto the Middle East, first stop Iran! Weve both wanted to visit Iran for such a long time, and have been looking forward to travelling there for a while, but obviously this whole political situation is a little off putting. Were two Australians, Ill travel on my Australian passport but I do have a British passport on my person. I know a few weeks ago, two Australians got arrested for flying a drone.  want to travel to Israel later in the trip so we feel like this is the only time we can travel to Iran because with an Israeli stamp in our passport, that closes the door (I know theres ways around it, but those ways wont really be applicable to us).  be in Iran this time next month if all goes to plan. We will purchase travel insurance so if all goes south we can get our money back. Our parents are FREAKING out telling us not to go, but I think itll be OK. Surely enough tourists would be there that wed be evacuated in case of an all out war... but who knows. Maybe someone with more experience on on the verge of war travel can help us out!",1

Accounting for miles earned by paying cash for ticket it very likely is triple the cost to give money up front for them to have now, and I travel later. just break even I'd need to buy the 60k miles but net 211k miles via the bonus (250% bonus). The best Alaska has ever offered that I saw was a paltry 50%. math over... I missing something? Is this just a marketing ploy to get you to consider travel or something? Have any of you ever actually purchased miles outright?  thing I can think of is maybe for international upgrades, but even then, in my experience the miles needed to bump to first class tend to be 100k+, so we either buy business class outright, or bump to it via earned miles from credit card usage...",1

I work a good job that pays kinda well for my age ( it's not what I imagined my self doing - fairly corporate) but everything is pretty stable.  have been travelling before around Asia for 3 months but I really really would like to go again, maybe South America or parts I missed in Asia. However I feel the situation im in makes it difficult, my boyfriend is so lovely to me but he is more interested in getting a house and settling down. I don't feel like I'm ready for that. I want to go away and do all these amazing things still and I'm starting to feel pretty trapped and I don't want to drag him along just for the ride when I know his hearts not in it.  think I want to travel alone this time - quit my job leave London and just go for it. But I feel a sense of responsibility I have here, has anyone else had similar experiences or feelings? I'm not sure what to do?  recognize that these are not really 'problems' just trying to navigate the situation right! Don't wanna wake up when I'm 40 with a whole load of regrets",1

We plan to spend our last two nights in Dublin, giving us at least one full day. Have no idea what time well end up in Dublin on the first day - a Friday. Shooting for mid-afternoon, but it depends on how the previous days go and how behind we are. So Im booking all our must-dos that require timed tickets in advance for Saturday, and thinking about this order (was going to plan on buying these tix this weekend so we arent shut out): Kilmainham Gaol
- Guinness 
- Book of Kells/Trinity College
- possibly Jameson Distillery.  addition, plan to squeeze in St. Patricks Cathedral somewhere in there. Then Friday and Saturday night well plan on visiting a few pubs as well as visit the Temple Bar area. I feel this is doable. Anything other must-dos we must do? this is a random question Im not sure if anyone has experience with it if we buy the timed ticket for Saturday for an attraction and we find ourselves actually in Dublin Friday afternoon and say Guinness has tickets available, do they allow you to swap your tickets, freeing up tickets for someone else Saturday? are there any city locations/areas you like to stay in in Dublin?",1

Obviously i'll hit the big cities, but i'm wondering about smaller less well known attractions or locations to visit.  Could be anything from a cool museum to some old house that's still standing after 200 years.  If you've been somewhere and you thought it was really cool, let me know!  Oh and good food stops as well!!  This trip will be half attractions, half food. potentially on the list: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.  I also have family in Texas, so i may end my trip there before heading back to MN.  So if something is close by, i may be tempted to stop there. you for reading and taking the time to respond!

I've gotten mixed reviews scrolling through endless reddit posts about logistics on booking through different companies. Of all the companies I have found online, the one that looks the most organized and most professionally put together for the price seems to be [Salkantay Trekking Company]( They're quoting the 5d 4n trek at $450 USD. If you click that link it shows the trip to include the Glass domes, Andean tents, Jungle Domes, and stay in a Hostel below Machu Picchu. World Class chefs,  everything included etc. Compared to other Trekking Companies, they seem to have the most bang for your buck. Now... a lot of posts I saw said book well in advance, but then a lot of them said you can book a couple days in advance in Cusco while you're there getting used to the altitude for a much cheaper price. I'd obviously much rather book for a much cheaper price, but does anyone have experience doing so and getting that high quality trekking experience with any of the local companies? in advance",1
