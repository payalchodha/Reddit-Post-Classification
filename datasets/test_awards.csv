0,"I Have A Ton of Hyatt Points & Don't Know What I Should DoI currently have 69,022 Hyatt points and am a Globalist due to a lengthy stay over the summer. I've never done any kind of reward program for any hotel/credit card/airline etc so I have no idea how to leverage these to my best advantage. also received emails stating I have  awards of:

 5000 points or $100 Hyatt Gift Card or 10,000 point savings on a Find Experience points or 1 Suite Upgrade points or 1 Suite Upgrade points or 1 Suite Upgrade points or 1 Suite Upgrade basically another 45,000 points on top of the 69,022, so 114,022 points total. points basically equal free nights correct? Lower tier Hyatt's are lesser points I gather? don't care about suites really, so I'm thinking redeem the points? Is there a strategy I should employ to use these the best way possible?",0
1,"New to Air Miles and collecting with Alaska. What kind of deals/discounts can I expect? Anything that I should be prepared for?I just started flying a lot for work with Alaska Airlines. In my first month I've accrued 14k, which probably isn't much compared to many people, but I'm wondering whether I might have enough in a few weeks to take a trip somewhere....or is that not how it works? there a basic 'miles to money' exchange rate or does it not really work like that? Will they ALWAYS make me pay cash in addition to miles rather than getting to fly for 'free' just by spending miles alone? Or will they make it really difficult for me to find a date/time where my miles are actually valid? Should I bother collecting miles or is it generally worthless, OR should I collect them but not expect them to let me fly around the world for free?",0
2,"Choosing airlines for trip to Maldives & ThailandLooking to book a trip to Maldives and Thailand either March/April or November/December 2020.

6,"Any way to get covered for cancelling HK flight by travel insurance booked using CSR?We had booked a flight for Taiwan, Vietnam, Hong Kong in May for Christmas vacations. Unfortunately HK has gone from bad to worse in the months, and after monitoring it just feels non judicious to go there. Given that I booked the flights using Chase Sapphire Reserve, is there any way for me to get them to cover the flight change costs? It sounds like ""disinclination to travel due to civil unrest"" is not a covered reason, and ""travel advisory due to terrorism"" has a specific meaning when it comes to terrorism as defined by US government. What can I do short of covering the flight change costs myself? Is my perception of HK being unsafe to travel right now correct based on any first-hand recent experiences?",0

17,"Qantas Phantom AvailabilityHi,
 trying to book a business class seat with AA points on Qantas from SFO-PER and then return DRW-SFO in May through June of next year. I'm quite flexible with my dates. I've used the Qantas search function to verify that there's actually business class availability, but when I go on AA's website to book it it says the flight is ""no longer available."" When I call AA I get told by the agent on the phone that they only show economy seats but no business seats despite their website displaying otherwise. 
 my question is: Is there a trick to booking phantom seats on Qantas with AA or am I SOL and have to fly economy?

18,"Andaz Papagayo: Is the all-inclusive package a good value during award stays?I've been reading old posts on this sub, and everyone who's been to the Hyatt Andaz Papagayo in Costa Rica says that despite it being a lovely stay and a great award redemption, the food is still pretty pricey and there aren't many meal options off-site. With that in mind, can anyone here attest to the value of tacking on the all-inclusive offer to an award stay? spoke with a rep for the hotel and confirmed that the all-inclusive add-on for award stays is $300 per night for two people, plus 13 percent tax and 10 percent tip. Based on my research, I figure it'll be pretty easy to hit a daily dining tab of $150 per person, but would still love some first-hand data points if they're out there. details on my trip, in case it's of interest: Just booked a 5-night award stay for me and the SO in late March 2020 at a hotel value of 3.4 cpp and award flights on UA at a value of 1.8 cpp (in Y; I didn't have enough to book an everyday J fare for two people, and all the saver fares in J were taken). It's not the best value ever for flights, but I figure I'll need lots of cash to pay for meals and activities once we're there. The trip technically falls outside the window of the current all-inclusive offer at the property, but if it's a good deal, I figure it can't hurt to try and persuade a Hyatt rep to add it to our reservation. (EDIT: The rep tells me that in spite of my travel dates, I can still choose to buy the all-inclusive deal at check-in.) here are some highlights from my research, in case it helps somebody else: Previous visitors have reported the continental breakfast costing $19 per person and the breakfast buffet costing $30+ per person. (I know breakfast is included if you have Globalist status, but I'm only an Explorist so for now I'm acting as if I'll pay for breakfast.) I've read that cocktails are similarly expensive, and [this menu]( I found for one of the four restaurants on the resort lists small plates ranging from $11 to $34 each.",0

I'm about 12k EQMs and $500 EQDs away from AA Gold status, so I'd like to make those 12k EQMs on this trip since I only have a few AA flights left in the year, all inexpensive domestic flights. Work will pay for the tickets, but it has to be pretty similarly priced to the cheapest roundtrip economy ticket available, regularly about $1100 on Emirates via DXB). A few options I've considered: on Qatar. About $1300 if I pick ideal dates, but in a V-fare I'd only get 0.50 EQMs and 0.10 EQDs. on Cathay Pacific. About $1200, and a several-day stopover in Hong Kong would be free. However there are no AA earnings unless I book premium economy, which is nearly double the price. on AA-codeshare Cathay Pacific ($940) plus HKG-BLR-HKG on Indigo ($340). The highest-earning option I can think of with 1.00 EQMs and 1.00 on any economy ticket (they don't offer basic economy for this routing), but the connection in HKG is only 2h20m, and I'd have to pass through customs to recheck my bags (Indigo does not have interline agreements), so I don't know if this is too tight. Alternatively I could bring no checked bags, or stay in HKG another day in addition to staying there on the way back. If anyone knows how to get this routing entirely under AA that would be fantastic but I suspect it's not possible. can't think of any options that would be similar to Hong Kong here, since there's not any other nearby hubs that serve Bangalore, and booking a return ticket from a separate airport adds to the cost.",0

One of these seats is for our 1 year old toddler (we figured itd be easier for everyone for him to have his own seat on a 15 hour flight). I had been checking the reservation on AA the past few months for seat selection options and, when seeing no option, assumed they would just put us together when we check in. When booking, the AA agent didnt give me JAL record locator numbers. just called AA to ask about seat selection and found out our JAL record locator numbers. When I plugged this into the JAL website, it shows there arent 3 seats together anymore. Does this mean all the grayed out seats have already been selected by other passengers and were SOL? Itd really suck, after getting a third seat for our otherwise lap child, for only one of us to be next to the toddler and not have help from the other parent. Does anyone know how accommodating JAL can be in these situations? in advance for any help you can offer!!",0

I've been dreading this day because I would always get lost on the best approach to booking flights/hotels. have a combined total of 700k Ultimate Reward points. I have a Sapphire Reserve & she has a Sapphire Preferred. We're trying to go all out on this trip (business/first flights + nicer hotels) with the idea that we can book saver fares to get the most bang for 'buck'. on everything I've read, sending points directly United would be my best option due to lower taxes/fuel charges, but I read this will be increasing starting next month. Average saver business pricing seems to be 140k points/pp + a couple hundred in taxes/fees with a stop somewhere on the East coast. Seems like no non-stop flights from LAX. All other airlines seem to have an exorbitant amount of fuel surcharges. As for hotels, I am not sure if I should look into Marriott/Hyatt or just book through the UR Portal. for recommendations to book the ""ultimate"" two week honeymoon from LAX to Italy (trying to hit Venice, Rome, & Amalfi Coast, likely via train)... and maybe even using the ""free"" United excursionist perk for a night or two in Paris. No preference as to what city we start/end the trip. questions below, but feel free to comment on any other part of my plan: Is sending UR points to United the best option for someone flying out of LAX to Italy?

145,"3rd RTW tripJust read an older post on the ANA RTW fare and thought I would add my experiences.  In 2015 we did an RTW ticket with Delta right before they disappeared.  We paid virtually nothing in taxes (those were the days).  In 2017 we did an RTW with United, again right before it disappeared.  Our taxes were negligible and in both cases we flew business and first class.  First trip we were gone 70 days second trip gone 50 days.  This third trip is 70 days. RTW booked with Korean Air.  Yes it is frustrating trying to figure out all the little rules and regulations for each ticket and takes a number of phone calls but it is worth it each time you learn a little more to book with.  For example when Delta booked us in 2015 they could book us back tracking if that was what was available for flights and those legs did not count against us.  However with Korean air you can back track within regions, but legs are strictly limited and legs within regions are also limited.  So we augmented 2 legs on our own to make it work.   ship to Dubai-***DBX***\-ICN-***RGN***\-KMG (our own segment in the same carrier)-***SYD***\-***MEL***(our own segment using BA points)-PVG-ATL-TPA. bold are our stops, the taxes were high, $2500, but they are business/first awards.  Would have been less if I could have managed the metal better, but in 2015 the RTW included Seoul so we didn't want to go back.  We each signed up for Korean air visa cards and transferred points that we had.   strongly recommend the RTW, this is 220,000 miles again business/first.  It is hard to book point to point award travel for that level of miles.",0

They currently have 45,000 miles and need 30,000 more. The other parent has hundreds of thousands of marriott points, and the plan was to transfer from Marriott to mileageplus. Unfortunately, because Marriott is associated with one parent and the mileageplus account is associated with the other, that isn't possible. And transferring the marriott points into a seperate mileageplus account then to the parent who needs them would incur a $500+ fee for transfering miles. from purchasing miles (not really an option), the only solution I can think of is to add parent as an authorized user on one of my UR cards, and transfer miles to them. Is this solution viable? I have 200,000+ UR, so it doesn't matter to me. And I don't believe that my or my parents credit will be hit by adding an authorized user and it won't count towards my 5/24 for Chase. insight would help! Thanks!",0

186,"Any better options for RGN -> BOS next month?Looking to book one-way travel from Yangon, Myanmar (RGN) to Boston (BOS) around 11/13/2019, dates flexible +/-2 days.      have **60,000 AA** and **101,000 UR** (+CIP)
   
**Additional notes:**    
- Looking to book J, at least for the longest leg of the flight. Would be okay with premium economy if it makes flights more seamless    
- Not particularly averse to long layovers or multiple stops, as long as there are decent lounge options (Priority Pass)    
- Averse to fees, would like to pay less than $100 cash    
- Willing to travel by land to BKK if flight options are significantly better, but prefer keeping RGN as origin.    
&nbsp; what I've found so far:**    
- 90k (+$58) on United for J (RGN-BKK-ZRH-BOS; 35 hr travel time)    
- RGN-HKG-BOS is 70K AA for J, but unless there's an easy way to earn ~9,000 AA in a month in SEA that's not feasible     that's pretty much it. Not sure if availability will open up, or if these are my best options. I am in no rush to book so can wait on availability, but would like some direction as to whether that's likely and if I'm looking in the right place.    ",0

243,"W Barcelona - Points DecisionsHey r/awardtravel ! We wanted to write a post about a points analysis, redemption, and stay we took advantage of a few weeks ago in Spain at the iconic [W Barcelona Hotel]( We had two nights after a Mediterranean Cruise to stay in Barcelona and have a serious affinity toward the W Hotel brand. Before the cruise we had stayed at the [Barcelona EDITION Hotel]( for 60,000 Marriott Bonvoy Points, which I had to top off with 20,000 American Express Membership Rewards for the stay. Totally worth it! The Barcelona EDITION was in the Gothic Quarter, and we wanted to check out the Beach during this next stay, so we decided on the W Barcelona. We had three points currencies to analyze before we made our final booking decision, here are our cost calculations: Decisions and Cash Costs** we were heading to the beach in one of the tallest buildings in Barcelona naturally we wanted a room with an Ocean view. This proved to be well worth it when we saw the view [later]( To be honest it felt like we were still on a cruise when would looked out our giant windows! being said we selected a Wonderful Room with a King Bed and Ocean View. cash value of this room was just under $500 a night, the first night being $486.92 and the second being $491.97. Taxes came to be $82.48. The grand cash total of the stay would cost **$1,067.45**, plus $11.14 in local and city tax upon check-in. The Points** Amex Travel this two night stay would have cost **120,000 Membership Rewards Points**. the Marriott Bonvoy App we got the same result, **120,000 Marriott Bonvoy Points**. of these options would have gotten us a much less than desirable $0.0089/cents per point (cpp) redemption. I'd say this was about average for most Marriott Bonvoy Point redemptions according to TPG's evaluation... but we tend to shoot for over $0.014/cpp for Marriott Bonvoy Points. Same goes with the American Express Membership Rewards, terrible cpp redemption rate, so we didn't think twice. we checked Chase Ultimate Rewards, which came in at a low points price of **70,420 Ultimate Rewards Points**! With our Chase Sapphire Reserve we were able take full advantage of that 50% extra value on awards bookings and get a $0.015/cpp redemption. wait, here is where more value gets added in! Thanks to our Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite Status we were issued an upgrade from our Wonderful Room, to a Cool Corner Suite with a King Bed! Rates for that room were 642 Euros, or $700 USD!!!  This Cool Corner Suite room would have totaled in at 1,417.81 Euros, or **$1546.05 USD**. If you were to factor that price into the 70,420 Ultimate Rewards, our cents per points total would have been just about $0.022/cpp. This being said, we were even more excited about this redemption and the availability for an upgrade! post is already getting lengthy and the W Barcelona is truly a destination of its own. Feel free to watch our full tour and review of the W Barcelona [here]( We are on a mission to hit all the W Hotels and EDITION Hotels worldwide, as well as all of the American Express Centurion Lounges! Stay tuned for more if this interests you!",0

253,"[Trip Report] Round the Trip  Round the World Trip](
 laid off of work a few weeks ago, figured why not lets do a round the trip.


 Location/Flights |Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
JFK-BCN-HEL | 30K AA | No nonstop flight available from Finnair so I took this JFK-BCN on AA metal then BCN-HEL on Finnair to Helsinki. 
Klaus K Hotel - Marriott | 2 Free Marriott night cert | Good location for this hotel. Walking distance to everything. However the base room is pretty small, even worse the bathroom. Nothing separate the shower drainage from the rest of the bathroom, so it gets flooded when I took a shower.
HEL-DOH| 20k AA| Flew via Qatar Airways to DOH.
DOH-CAN, Qatar F|50k AA | Now this was the main reason why I took this trip. I want to check off all 3 Middle East First Class flights off my flight bucket list. This route was the easiest to snag a Qatar First Class seat. While it's not as flashy and extravagant as Etihad or Emirates, I found QR F to be very classy. It definitely felt private as I was the only person in F. The bar/lounge was pretty nice as well. Flight was only 8 hours. As for the seat, I found it to be much more comfy than SQ's new seat, EY F, JL F, ANA F.
Grand Hyatt Guangzhou|24k Hyatt| Visited some family in Guangzhou so the QR F route made perfect sense for me. I was highly impressed by this Grand Hyatt. The base room is gorgeous, floor to ceiling windows, comfy bed, showers right behind the bed with windows, which is perfect for couples imo. I was also highly impressed by their breakfast. Very good west and east food options. Would not hesitate to book this hotel again.
CAN-HND | 14k Avios | About a 4 hour flight on JAL metal.
Wise Owl Hostel 3 Nights | $100 or so | Didn't realize how far this hostel was from Shibuya Station. Cool roommates but a bitch of a walk
Hyatt Regency Tokyo | 12k Hyatt | Stayed here before. Wanted a good bed for my last night. I did ask for Tokyo 2020 availability but they said hotel is blocked for officials.
NRT-JFK, JAL F | 80k AA | Third time flying JAL F, packed flight, did not get a window seat like I wanted. The new Sakura First Class lounge is huge. Two large dining area with a larger sushi bar/space. Doesn't have the views like the old lounge but still good. The biz lounge is much larger taking half the old space of the F lounge. Met a fellow churner on board the flight. I think we killed a bottle of Hibiki while we bullshitted.

 Always wanted to say I've been to HEL and now I did. All the salmon dishes were delicious, from the smoked salmon to salmon soup. Very small city. 2 days was more than enough here.


 I didn't have much time in the Al Safwa Lounge. Huge lounge, very quiet, always felt sterile due to it. Wish I had a little more time to drink some more.


 I quite enjoyed QR F. I get why Q Suites is better. The soft product is basically the same, but there's nothing like flying on an A380. For 50k AA DOH-CAN, its a steal imo. Seat was very comfy. I rank it to be very high. Best for me is still SQ's old suite.


 Went to Teamlab Borderless exhibit in Tokyo. Highly recommend this to everyone. This experience was out of this world. The lights and sound really took me to another place. Recommend being there at opening time to take all your photos before the crowds come in.

 I was a bit disappointed by the new Toyosu Market. It felt sterile and no personality compare to the old Tskuji Market. Waited 2 hours for Sushi Dai, worth it for the price point, spent $80 for their omakase on top of 4-5 extra pieces. I usually spend double that in NYC.

 All and all, this was a fun last minute trip for me. Booked on a Monday/Tuesday, flew out on Thursdays. This is why I love this hobby, last minute flights out. I'm a bit stressed in finding a new job but also feel very free to figure out my next trip.",0
254,need advice on itinerary where i need one more seatHi all - sure if this is possible but I've found an transatlantic J award itinerary on AAdvantage (flying BA metal) where 1 seat is available but i am looking for two.   A second seat is (or more seats are) open in economy for the identical itinerary.  Is there any way to either (i) waitlist or (ii) call and ask if more space can be opened on the J class?  Or (iii) look elsewhere for more inventory?  I'm looking at PHX-> MUC on Sun 10/6.  There is a PHX->LAS->LHR->MUC that would work great if i could get two seats for me and the fiancee. help or advice appreciated!,0

We are for sure changing to this solely to save $1000/pp in BA fees and separate ticket costs to be refunded.

First two segments are Q Suite with suites already booked. 5Hr and 7Hr flight. Back from LHR, we would book the upper decker Biz class and pay for our seats.  is this flight departs at 1015am and bad weather could force us to depart the night before to main island or miss our return flight as it is during the rainy season.  2: 8p MLE-AUH-JFK/LGA (transit airports)-ORD (midnight)
This flight is on the new Etihad A380-800, but no F class, only J. New business class is nice and the 5Hr flight to AUH is in lie flat as well.  benefit is this flight departs at 830pm, providing less opportunity for a missed flight or early departure to main island from Conrad Maldives. However, airport transfer does suck, but there is a 6hour layover. All in J except for LGA-ORD.  3: 6p MLE-AUH-ORD (3p) flight departs also at 6pm, a plus, to avoid the chance of early departure or missed flight from Conrad to Male main island.  is that this is the older 77W plane that needs updating. Plus is that it is one stop with the shortest travel time.  think that the first flight is a given to change and I already have it held. As for the return flight, I am torn. The QSuites would be amazing to experience and the flight BA fees were negligible ($300).

291,"Layover in LHR duration.I'm waiting for a flight to open up to book via AA miles (farthest out is late August 2020, I need mid-September), but looking at flights on similar days of the week, it looks like I'll have two options. One includes a 1.5 hour layover in LHR, while the other is 4 hours. Is 1.5 hours for a layover enough? I'll be flying business class in a intra-Europe flight so I will be one of the first off the flight.",0
292,"ATL Trip QuestionGoing on a trip with my mother to Atlanta in late November.  She booked one night at the Marriott Midtown Suites.. she initially thought she had 2 reward certificates for 2 nights, but only had 1.  I was going to book the second night.  I have plenty of UR and AMEX points.  I'm open to booking at the same hotel for the second night for the sake of not having to bounce around hotels.  Am I better off using UR or AMEX points here?  If UR, should I look at transferring to Bonvoy (I have yet to open an account) assuming there is a lower point room there?  Or should I look at doing another hotel within the WOH chain due to the potentially better point transfer differences they usually have there?",0
293,"Buenos Aires to CuracaoI currently have a trip booked to fly from IAH to Buenos Aires (EZE) in mid Jan 2020. We had planned on going to Chile after, flying back to IAH from Santiago (SCL). We decided that instead of Chile, we want to go to Curacao (CUR). Both long flights were in United Business Class, saver awards. Looking at United, We can fly from EZE to Panama to CUR on Copa, but only have enough points for economy. Are there any other options that I should look into to be able to fly business? If there is a stop, maybe the longer leg business, the shorter leg can be economy?",0

295,"Another ANA RTW booking reportI'm defending my dissertation in early May so the wife and I are going to celebrate with a trip around the world. Final itinerary is below (I really hope I formatted that correctly).  It was a long journey (narrowing down [this]( to [this]( but I finally bit the bullet and called to book yesterday. The booking went pretty smoothly overall. Initial call took about a half hour and they had to call back later to take payment information. Total taxes and fees were less than I expected. ITA Matrix estimates put it at $525 each plus the phone booking fee but I was only charged $901 for 2. especially excited for the TPE-CDG leg on BR. I believe something happened about 2 weeks ago where Air Canada pulled partner availability for a lot of their 1XXX flights from Europe to YYZ and YUL (MAD,FCO,VCE,etc). I was planning to fly from FCO/VCE to YYZ/YUL but then those flights disappeared from search and then the flight I wanted from ZRH-YYZ lost availability. Ended up settling for BRU-YYZ. I was pretty deadset on flying back from Europe to NA with AC to save on YQ. I also considered flying YVR-NRT on AC instead of the YVR-HND on NH but I figured the extra $100 pp in YQ was well worth being able to fly NH in J. to book CDG-FCO/NAP and then VCE-BRU off itinerary but I'll deal with that later. I wanted to thank everyone here who answered all of my questions (especially /u/TheChiffre) and providing advice putting together my itinerary.

296,"General Rule of Thumb for booking AI Hotels with a toddler?Trying to book a Hyatt Ziva property for my family next spring.  We are 5 - 2 adults and 3 kids (ages 12/10/3).  If I go to UR portal and enter 5 total, I do not get a master suite option.  Instead, I get Jr Suites (""with crib available"").  If I lower kid requirement to 4, I then get a whole bunch of other options. is the best strategy to book? Just book the Jr Suite and be done with it Book with 4 and then call the hotel later on and tell them there's a 3 YO who requires a crib (and pay whatever difference) in general for this kind of arrangement (family of 5), is it better to book via hyatt or UR?  There are conflicting DPs on this.",0
