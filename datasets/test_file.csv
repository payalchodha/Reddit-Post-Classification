18,schengen visa questionshi i belong to a country that requires a visa for europe prior to travel my initial plan is to stay with my boyfriend who s dutch in the nl i m not quire sure how to go about the visit visa intended stay is for days to spend the holidays with his family i don t have issues covering the expenses and i have business related reasons to come home and a year long lease for my apartment i m pretty alright with the list of requirements only thing that i m unsure about is whether to mention visiting other countries in the schengen we were initially planning to do two small weekends in germany and belgium because they re close by however this is not yet set because his family is also ushering us to join them in switzerland we re even contemplating just staying in the nl for the entire duration because there s so much confusion and overlap in planning was filling out the online application form a while ago and realized that they ask specifically if you re visiting countries aside from the nl we re not yet sure if we re even going to leave the nl or where to go will it be alright to just not mention yet the main destination still will not change since we re spending of my stay in the nl the ones i mentioned are small trips my point of entry and exit will still be the nl and as far as we re concerned the lack of border control between these countries mean that i should be alright for as long as i don t change my main destination,1

645,rd rtw tripjust read an older post on the ana rtw fare and thought i would add my experiences in we did an rtw ticket with delta right before they disappeared we paid virtually nothing in taxes those were the days in we did an rtw with united again right before it disappeared our taxes were negligible and in both cases we flew business and first class first trip we were gone days second trip gone days this third trip is days rtw booked with korean air yes it is frustrating trying to figure out all the little rules and regulations for each ticket and takes a number of phone calls but it is worth it each time you learn a little more to book with for example when delta booked us in they could book us back tracking if that was what was available for flights and those legs did not count against us however with korean air you can back track within regions but legs are strictly limited and legs within regions are also limited so we augmented legs on our own to make it work ship to dubai dbx icn rgn kmg our own segment in the same carrier syd mel our own segment using ba points pvg atl tpa bold are our stops the taxes were high but they are business first awards would have been less if i could have managed the metal better but in the rtw included seoul so we didn t want to go back we each signed up for korean air visa cards and transferred points that we had strongly recommend the rtw this is miles again business first it is hard to book point to point award travel for that level of miles,0
