There are no transfers and its pretty much an overnight trip. What snacks work with what little luggage Im allowed for carry on? Especially with a child.  What should we expect? Especially at the station for pick up (Phoenix). And what is a good way to keep at least him comfortable? Also, are the plugs usually in working condition? And what is the bathroom situation?

18,"Schengen Visa QuestionsHi! I belong to a country that requires a visa for Europe prior to travel. My initial plan is to stay with my boyfriend (who's Dutch) in the NL, I'm not quire sure how to go about the visit visa. intended stay is for 20 days to spend the holidays with his family. I don't have issues covering the expenses, and I have business-related reasons to come home (and a year-long lease for my apartment). I'm pretty alright with the list of requirements. only thing that I'm unsure about is whether to mention visiting other countries in the Schengen. We were initially planning to do two small weekends in Germany and Belgium because they're close-by. However, this is not yet set because his family is also ushering us to join them in Switzerland. We're even contemplating just staying in the NL for the entire duration because there's so much confusion and overlap in planning.  was filling out the online application form a while ago and realized that they ask specifically if you're visiting countries aside from the NL.  we're not yet sure if we're even going to leave the NL (or where to go), will it be alright to just not mention yet? The main destination still will not change since we're spending 90% of my stay in the NL. The ones I mentioned are small trips. My point of entry and exit will still be the NL. And, as far as we're concerned, the lack of border control between these countries mean that I should be alright for as long as I don't change my main destination.",1

I have a Chase Bank Visa card (it's a Debit card) but I don't know if there are any Chase Banks in Edmonton.  I don't drive so I'll be taking buses to get from the airport to the city and to get to the mall (Taxis will likely get expensive and I only have an old fashioned flip phone so services like Lyft and Uber are out of the question). Will I need to have any Canadian coins on hand to ride the bus or will they accept American coins? This is my first time flying outside to USA so I want to make sure I have everything I need.",1

29,"What do you think of my Europe itinerary?Hey! I'm backpacking around Europe for 42 days in winter and after much deliberation have landed on the below itinerary. explain some of it: My boyfriend is joining me for half the trip in the middle and we planned that bit first based on where he really wanted to go (Berlin, Prague and I want him to come with me to Sweden). That's why geographically the route isn't in a neat circuit. The Vsters detour is to visit family/indulge in some nostalgia on my behalf. terms of how long I stay in each city I'm trying to balance a desire to explore a city thoroughly without wanting to stay there *too* long and missing out on other places. Also Vienna and Munich are kind of squished in between our priority cities Prague and Berlin. both separately flying into Amsterdam (landing very early, leaving very late). He's meeting me in Sweden and heading back after Berlin. flight in and out of Ams, my budget is around 6000 EUR. The below transport and accom adds up to around 1300 EUR, staying in hostels. Double rooms when we're together and female dorms otherwise. 4 nights

I want to share my own personal experiences over a series of posts and stories from the road and specific locations and road trips Ive done over my 25 year old lifetime. Most of these trips have been within the last 2 years and I think the stories will catch the excitement of others and inspire people to get out on the road themselves. Ive come up with specific destination topics and will write about and release a short story for each one. Ive listed the chosen locations and I cant wait to get started! All of these trips (besides Europe) have taken place with me and a few friends in the drivers seat of my 2010 RAV4, the most trustworthy car I could have hoped for!First post coming soon, I hope you all enjoy the stories.

During this time, we will take a few days to travel and explore independently as well, and we're struggling to think of where/what to visit. We're probably going to spend a day or two in Manhattan, and we're planning to go for a couple of days to the Niagra Falls, and possibly to Washington (although I can't think of anything particularly interesting there except for the whitehouse, which is still not that impressive).

- mountains
- hiking 
- cabin-in-the-woods feel 
- ideally also close to some civilization so we could have a nice dinner once or twice  live in eastern Virginia, right on the coast. Wed like to drive so we could have our car and not go through the added trouble and cost of a rental, but we have limited vacation time, so ideally the drive would only be a day or two worth of driving (no problem with spending the night somewhere on the way). We really wanted to go to Banff National Park, but thatd be like a 3.5 day drive and would eat up lots of time. Before we bite the bullet and look at flying, anyone have any suggestions?

* 8/28-8/30: **Lyon** via train (food is all I really know about the town so any other suggestions as well)
* 8/30-9/2: **Chamonix** via train (hiking, Aiguille du Midi cable car)
* 9/2-9/6: **Provence** via train - most likely **Aix-en-Provence** (Verdon Gorge, wineries, exploring)
* 9/6-9/9: **Nice** via train (beaches)
* 9/9: fly out of **Nice** questions:  does this itinerary sound? Should we leave out Lyon for more time in Chamonix/Provence region?  Aix-ev-Provence the best city to stay in the region? We're gonna rent a car to head to Verdon gorge but aside from that we'd like to spend a day or two around the wineries. I've seen tours online for that sort of thing but is there another time we can split the time between where we could rent bikes or something and explore the countryside and the wineries? there somewhere else you would suggest aside from Nice or is that our best option?

 know there are a lot but I'm one of those who don't relax on their vacation but after their return.

* Cholera x 2 = 55  ($70/65)
* Tick-borne encephalitis x 2 = 120 ($150/140)  \[plus a third shot a year from now for 60\] consultation fee or whatever.

390,"My airline just cancelled the flight and the next one will only happen in 48 hours. What measurements I should do to make sure I will get all proper compensations for it?First, the flight was delayed by two hours, them it was cancelled, so everyone had to pick up their luggage back and go home. It was a Canada to EU trip. I took a taxi back and went home. They told me that the airline will pay for all the taxi bills.  said that the next flight will only be after 48 hours from the original. It is a small company, so they only have one flight each two days. Since I have a home and wont be demanding them to pay hotel, I'm afraid that I'm the last one in line to be seated in another company flight.  know that the law varies and it is not really clear, but I wonder what measurements I should make in order that I won't lose any compensations. It is a huge mess for me, I already lost a booking and a train ride I was planning to do there. after a lot of research, it is NEVER clear what are my rights. Everywhere just says ""file a complain"", and I'm pretty sure if I ask the Travel Company, they will offer the bare minimum. What are my rights on that situation? 2: level airlines",1

I planned on doing the first half in Barcelona and the second half in Madrid. My hotel in Barcelona is still refundable and I hadn't booked plane/train tickets yet from Madrid to Barcelona.  look pretty messy at the moment in Barcelona with blockades at airports and train stations and large demonstrations on the streets. Should I consider postponing Barcelona at this time and checking out Seville/Granada instead with that extra time or something of that nature? Am I over-reacting?  not afraid of the protests but I'd obviously prefer to have a low-stress vacation. It also looks like a strike was pre-planned for Friday... ",1

Sometimes there are limited character spaces, especially when you book through meta searchers and OTAs, so how should I write my Name?  
I booked a flight with Eurowings last week from Germany to Austria under the names A and E only - would this be an issue since Germans are not used to multiple names? If I were flying from Portugal or Spain, I know this would not be a problem (although in Spain name B is more important than in Portugal, where name E is more important). Portuguese and Spanish People can kindly share their experiences.  
Please note that this is outside of the U.S., where I already know from experience that the answer there is that you have to put all names at all times.",1

She has always wanted to go to Ireland and we want to try to get her there before it's too late. found [this thread]( which makes me believe that traveling to Ireland is pretty accessible already, which is great to hear.

* Accessible accommodations for hotel/wherever we intend to sleep

I really want to get to know more about this continent by visitting different nations. I want to start going to countries where people are really friendly but I am not sure which one visit first. I thought I could start off through Portugal, then Spain, France, Romania...and then I go up. I don't have much money, I also need to figure out a way to keep travelling and return to Brazil. When my visa is renovated and my job allows me to travel, I would do so. I would love to make new friends and meet/talk to people who would be interested in chatting about their countries, languages and cultures. Places to visit,etc. I am also learning French and other languages. I want to learn basic Italian and my biggest challenge is German because it is really different from my mother tongue language which is Portuguese, plus a language that many European countries speak to, I believe that speaking a local language or at least a few sentences is a good way to know more about the people.
